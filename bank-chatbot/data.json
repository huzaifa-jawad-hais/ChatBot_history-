Introduction\nAMINA Bank AG (\u201cAMINA\u201d) may provide a range of services to its clients (the \u201cClients\u201d) that relate to digital assets registered on a blockchain or \nanother digital, distributed ledger or based on similar technology (collectively \u201cDigital Assets\u201d), including in particular trading, tokenization and \ncustody services.\nIssuing, trading, transacting, investing and holding positions in Digital Assets entails special risks to the Client, including technological,  \noperational, market and systemic risks as well as legal, regulatory and tax risks that may differ from and/or apply in addition to those exist -\ning in relation to traditional assets including any traditional financial instruments or national and supranational currencies. In a worst case  \nscenario, the realization of such risks may result in a total loss of the Client\u2019s investment and potentially additional losses in excess of the \noriginal investment, depending on the type of Digital Asset and the specifics of the Client\u2019s investment activity and exposure.\nII. Scope of this document\nThis document (the \u201cDigital Asset Risk Disclosure\u201d) provides information on certain special risks associated with Digital Assets as may be relevant \nto the Client from time to time in connection with its business relationship with AMINA.\nThis Digital Asset Risk Disclosure does not constitute nor purport to constitute exhaustive disclosure of all relevant risks or other relevant \naspects in connection with Digital Assets or transactions in such assets, and may not serve, under any circumstances, as a substitute for \nprofessional advice by competent subject matter experts. In particular, because the decentralised protocols that serve as underlying technol-\nogy of Digital Assets are still at an early stage of development and might be subject to fundamental changes in the future, the risks outlined \nherein, as well as the likelihood of their realisation, may evolve or change over time and new risks may arise. AMINA is entitled, but not obliged, \nto update this Digital Asset Risk Disclosure to take into account new developments, in particular technological, legal, regulatory or market \ndevelopments.\nUnless otherwise explicitly noted in this Digital Asset Risk Disclosure, the risks described herein are outside the sphere of influence of AMINA. \nOther than in specific, individual cases, e.g. where AMINA itself acts as issuer or sponsor of a Digital Asset subject to separate documentation \nand risk disclosure, AMINA has no influence on the issuance or continued existence nor on the functionality, convertibility or transferability of \nany Digital Asset, including with respect to any underlying assets.\nThis Digital Asset Risk Disclosure supplements and forms part of the contractual arrangements governing the relationship between AMINA and \nthe Client and must be read in conjunction with the general terms and conditions of AMINA (the \u201cGTC\u201d), the custody regulations of AMINA  \n(the \u201cCustody Regulations\u201d) and any other general or special terms of AMINA, as applicable. AMINA reserves the right to adjust and amend this \nDigital Asset Risk Disclosure at any time and to communicate such changes to the Client in accordance with the GTC.\nIII. Further relevant matters outside the scope of this document\nThis Digital Asset Risk Disclosure is separate from and in addition to the disclosure of risk factors by issuers, distributors, counterparties or other \npersons and financial services providers involved in the issuance, distribution, trading and other transactions relating to Digital Assets, as may in \nparticular be contained in prospectuses, key information documents, white papers, fact sheets and other information sheets and which describe \nin more detail the risks associated with a particular Digital Asset or category of Digital Asset.\nThe Client is required to study any such additional documents, where available, prior to investing, trading or transacting in any Digital Asset \nand shall take into account the risk factors disclosed therein in its decision-making process, in addition to the risks described in this Digital \nAsset Risk Disclosure.\nFurthermore, this Digital Asset Risk Disclosure does not discuss any matters of taxation or other legal matters in any jurisdiction relating to  \ninvestments and transactions in Digital Assets. The Client is advised to retain appropriate counsel in respect of legal and tax matters.\nIV. What are Digital Assets?\nDigital Assets are an evolving, non-uniform asset class characterized by the use of distributed ledger technology (\u201cDLT \u201d) or similar technology. \nMore specifically, Digital Assets are dematerialized assets constituted and existing as entries on a public, permissioned or private blockchain \nor other digital, distributed ledger only. The relevant distributed ledgers themselves and any data stored therein, including without limitation \nthe Digital Assets as such or any references thereto, are, unless explicitly specified otherwise in relevant documentation, not operated nor \ncontrolled by AMINA and therefore outside of the sphere of influence of AMINA.Special Risks of Digital Assets\nOctober 2019AMINA Bank AG\nKolinplatz 15 \u2022 6300 Zug \u2022 Switzerland \ninfo@aminagroup.com \u2022 aminagroup.com2\nIn particular, Digital Assets may constitute native units of value that do not include or represent any claim against an issuer or another third party. \nWhere such units are intended or used for payment purposes and do not qualify as nor represent securities or other financial instruments, they \nare sometimes referred to as payment tokens or (pure) crypto currencies (\u201cCrypto Currencies\u201d).\nOther types of Digital Assets may (i) constitute or represent any form of traditional, non-traditional or exotic financial instruments including \nshares, bonds, fund units, structured products or derivatives (sometimes referred to as asset tokens), (ii) grant a right of use to a digital service, \nplatform or infrastructure (sometimes referred to as utility tokens, or (iii) constitute a hybrid form of any of the aforementioned types of Digital \nAssets, including Crypto Currencies (sometimes referred to as hybrid tokens). Depending on their specific structure and depending on the rules \nof various jurisdictions, Digital Assets may, irrespective of the terminology used by an issuer or other involved parties, qualify as securities (in such \ncase sometimes referred to as security tokens) or other forms of financial instruments, with the associated legal and regulatory consequences, in \nparticular if they are suitable for investment purposes.\nWhile based on DLT, Digital Assets may be subject to centralization effects, e.g. due to concentration of ownership of issued/pre-mined units \nwith the issuer, another single party or a small number of related or unrelated parties, or due to concentration of network functions such as node \noperation or transaction validation with a single party or a small number of related or unrelated parties. This may cause Digital Assets to display \ncharacteristics of centrally issued instruments and/or may result in potentially detrimental effects for parties other than those participating in or \nhaving any effect on the concentration of ownership or network functions.\nDigital Asset Glossary\nTechnical Term Meaning and description\nAirdrop / Airgrab A distribution of Crypto Currency or other Digital Asset units to a defined scope of digital ledger addresses, usually without any compensation or other form  \nof remuneration due by the unit recipients, often for promotion or similar purposes.\nDLT Distributed Ledger Technology, referring to technology enabling the implementation of databases distributed on different nodes, or computer devices in a \nnetwork, each of which may individually participates in the network by replicating and saving a copy of the ledger or parts of it.\nNode A computer that participates in a DLT Network\nMiner/Minter Refers to a device or person that operates the device performing an act of creating valid blocks.\nSome protocols require demonstrating proof of work (done by \u201cMiners\u201d) while other consensus mechanisms require the staking of the assets (done by \u201cMinters\u201d). \nIn addition to the Miners and Minters, there are other consensus mechanisms which require different devices or persons, such as for example \u201cValidators\u201d in \nbyzantine fault tolerant mechanisms.\nBlockchain A specific form of database on DLT that employs a chain of blocks to reach consensus on the distributed ledger (DL)\nConsensus In the context of DLT consensus refers to the process (algorithm or mechanism) used to bring the distributed database to a synchronized state at a particular \ntime or block.\nHard fork A consensus affecting protocol change to which the participants that did not adopt the change will not be able to continue validating and verifying  \ntransactions.\nSoft fork A consensus affecting protocol change to which the participants that did not adopt the change will still be able to participate in validating and verifying \ntransactions.\n51% attack A 51% attack is a potential attack on a blockchain network, where a single entity or organization is able to control a high percentage of the hash rate,  \npotentially causing a network disruption. In such a scenario, the attacker would have enough mining power to intentionally exclude or modify the ordering of \ntransactions. Such attacker could potentially also reverse transactions, putting it in a position to double-spend the same unit of a Digital Asset. A successful \nmajority attack would further allow the attacker to prevent some or all transactions from being confirmed (transaction denial of service) or to prevent some or \nall other miners from mining, resulting in what is known as mining monopoly (censorship attack).\nCollision attack /  \nBirthday attackCollision Attack on a cryptographic hash tries to find two inputs producing the same hash value, i.e. a hash collision. This type of cryptographic attack exploits \nthe mathematics behind the birthday problem in probability theory and depends on the higher likelihood of collisions found between random attack attempts \nand a fixed degree of permutations. Such attack could be used to modify transactions.\nDusting Attack A dusting attack refers to a malicious activity where an attacker breaks the privacy of holders of a Digital Asset by sending very small amounts of coins to their \naddresses. The activity performed on these addresses is tracked down by the attacker and used in an attempt to identify the person or company behind an \naddress.\nV. Risks of financial instruments embodied in or serving as underlying of Digital Assets\nWhere Digital Assets constitute, embody, incorporate, reference or represent securities or other forms of financial instruments, as a general \nmatter, the risks applicable to such securities or other financial instruments apply in the same manner as for traditionally issued and traded  \ninstruments. As these risks apply generally and are not specific to Digital Assets, they are not further described herein.\nThe risks associated with trading in securities and other financial instruments are described and disclosed to the Client separately, in particular \non the basis of the brochure of the Swiss Bankers Association regarding Special Risks in Securities Trading as well as in other documents, oral and \nwritten information provided to the Client in the course of the business relationship with AMINA. AMINA Bank AG\nKolinplatz 15 \u2022 6300 Zug \u2022 Switzerland \ninfo@aminagroup.com \u2022 aminagroup.com3\nVI. Risks specific to Digital Assets\n1. Technology risks\n Risks of Digital Assets stemming from or relating to the specific use of technology may include, without limitation:\n- Risk of Digital Assets existing on a distributed ledger only: Unless explicitly specified otherwise, the distributed ledgers by which \nand on which Digital Assets exist are outside of the sphere of influence of AMINA. Digital Assets can be exposed to events  \nspecific to the relevant distributed ledger such as hard or soft forks in a blockchain which may inter alia lead to the creation of \nnew or competing Digital Assets, adversely affect the functionality, convertibility or transferability or result in a full or partial loss \nof units or reduction (including reduction to zero) of value of the Client\u2019s Digital Assets.\n- Risk of irreversibility of transactions/faulty instructions: Base layer transactions on a blockchain or other distributed ledger are \nirreversible and final and the history of transactions is computationally impractical to modify (i.e. would require more computing \npower than is reasonably expected to be available to any one person or group at any time). As a consequence, if the Client  \ninitiates or requests a transfer of Digital Assets using an incorrect digital ledger address, it will be impossible to identify the \nrecipient and reverse the defective transaction. This risk also applies if the Client attempts to transfer Digital Assets to AMINA \nusing an incorrect digital ledger address.\n- Risk of delayed execution: The execution of transactions in Digital Assets on a blockchain or other distributed ledger is subject  \nto verification and other processes involving multiple third party actors/nodes using evolving technology. This may result in \nsignificant waiting periods and delays during which the Client may be precluded from disposing over the relevant Digital Assets \nwhile their value may fluctuate significantly or which may otherwise result in loss or damages.\n- Risk of security weaknesses within the underlying code or technology: There is a risk that developers or other third parties may \nvoluntarily or involuntarily introduce weaknesses or errors into the underlying code or technology of a Digital Asset, which may \nbe exploited in various types of attacks. Successful attacks (or the perception of a technological weakness) might adversely \naffect the functionality, convertibility or transferability or result in a full or partial loss of units or reduction (including reduction  \nto zero) of value of the Client\u2019s Digital Assets.\n- Risk of exploitable breakthroughs in the field of cryptography, e.g. development of quantum computers: The state-of-the-art in \ncryptography, including digital encryption, may evolve over time. Advances in code decryption techniques and technical  \nadvances (including with regard to the computing power required to deploy such techniques) could pose risks to the security \nof Digital Assets and, if exploited, may lead to the theft, loss of units or reduction in value (including reduction to zero) of the \nClient\u2019s Digital Assets.\n- Risks inherent to consensus mechanisms and concentration risk: DLT may be contingent on independent validators or other \nforms of consensus formation or validation susceptible to external attacks. Potential attacks include e.g. collision attacks,  \n51% attacks, dusting attacks and censorship attacks. If successful, such attacks may e.g. enable a perpetrator to take control \nof Digital Assets, engage in double spending of the same Digital Asset and/or otherwise abuse the identity or personal data of \nother users. Furthermore, any such attack may adversely affect the functionality, convertibility or transferability or result in a \nfull or partial loss of units or reduction (including reduction to zero) of value of the Client\u2019s Digital Assets. The risk of a successful \nattack is elevated in Digital Assets based on DLT architecture with a high degree of concentration of unit ownership or network \nfunctions with a small number of parties.\n2. Legal and regulatory risks\n Risks of Digital Assets relating to the legal and regulatory environment may include, without limitation:\n- Risk of non-compliance or change of legal and regulatory framework: The legal and regulatory framework governing Digital  \nAssets in and outside of Switzerland is far from settled and continuously evolving. Existing laws and regulations, changes to the \nlegal and regulatory framework and related measures by regulators or other governmental authorities may affect the compliant \nissuance, domestic and international tradability and transferability or convertibility of the Client\u2019s Digital Assets and may  \npotentially result in a full or partial loss of units or reduction of value (including reduction to zero) thereof.\n- Risk of supervisory measures in one or more jurisdictions: Digital Assets, their issuers or other involved parties, financial and other \nservice providers may become subject to regulatory investigations, injunctions or other measures which may potentially result \nin a full or partial loss or reduction of value of the Client\u2019s Digital Assets, impact the ability to offer Digital Assets to the Client \nor otherwise affect the Client. Further, such measures may impede, restrict or prohibit the Client from holding or transacting in \nDigital Assets.\n- Risk of seizure of Digital Assets: The technology underlying Digital Assets enables thorough forensic investigations that may be \nable to reach back and cover a period of time and number of transactions that would not be possible with similar effort in the \ncontext of traditional assets. Depending on the individual case, such forensic investigations could cover a period reaching back \nto the generation of the relevant Digital Asset. As a result, the Client\u2019s Digital Assets may be subject to a risk of seizure by courts \nor governmental authorities where they have been previously used for or in connection with criminal activities or may otherwise \nbe considered \u201ctainted\u201d . Depending on the way the Client invests in or holds Digital Assets (e.g. in specific, segregated storage  \narrangements, by investing in a financial product with one or several Digital Assets as base value, or in a non-segregated \naccount representing a contractual claim for delivery of a specific amount of a Digital Asset) and/or on the types of trades or \ntransactions regarding Digital Assets that the Client engages in, the Client may from time to time hold be assigned, or receive \nin exchange, different units in the same Digital Asset, some of which may be subject to an elevated risk of seizure or may be \n\u201ctainted\u201d to differing degrees. Release of seized Digital Assets may be subject to foreign laws or regulations and the relevant \nprocedures may result in costs, delays or other adverse effects to the Client.AMINA Bank AG\nKolinplatz 15 \u2022 6300 Zug \u2022 Switzerland \ninfo@aminagroup.com \u2022 aminagroup.com4\n- Risk of legal ineffectiveness of tokenization or transfer of tokenized rights: Where Digital Assets are intended to constitute,  \nembed or represent securities or other financial instruments, the legal effectiveness of such construct may be subject to  \ndiffering rules in the potentially relevant jurisdictions, including in particular the jurisdiction of the issuer or the holder of the \nrelevant Digital Asset. There is a risk that tokenization of the supposedly underlying rights and obligations and/or the transfer of \nsuch rights and obligations by transfer of a Digital Asset may not be legally effective and that, consequently, the Client\u2019s Digital \nAssets may not include the expected rights and obligations, potentially resulting in a full or partial loss of units or reduction of \nvalue (including reduction to zero) thereof.\n- Classification risk: AMINA may in its discretion from time to time determine for the purposes of its business relationship with \nthe Client whether it considers a particular Digital Asset a Crypto Currency or another instrument such as a security or other \nfinancial instrument. Such classification is inter partes between the Client and AMINA only. AMINA cannot be held liable for any \ndiffering classification by authorities or other competent third parties in any jurisdiction at any given point in time, which may \nresult in differing rights and obligations of the Client in respect of its Digital Assets in various jurisdictions over time. These may \ninclude legal and regulatory duties, tax obligations or other requirements, non-compliance with which may result in measures \nand sanctions including criminal liability, or which may otherwise affect the legal position of the Client or the value,  \ntransferability or convertibility of the relevant Digital Assets.\n3. Market Risks\n Risks of Digital Assets relating to the relevant markets, trading platforms and systems may include, without limitation:\n- Markets in Digital Assets are evolving: The markets in Digital Assets are evolving and may be subject to elevated volatility and  \nlimited transparency and reliability, execution delays or failures, all of which may potentially result in losses or other adverse  \neffects for the Client.\n- Limited regulation: Trading platforms and systems in Digital Assets and their participants may be unregulated or subject to  \nlimited regulation and may not provide for the same or similar safeguards as would apply in traditional financial markets,  \nincluding with respect to market manipulation or insider trading. All of these inherent particularities may potentially result in \nlosses or other adverse effects for the Client.\n- Delays in execution or settlement of transactions in Digital Assets: Execution and settlement of transactions in Digital Assets \nmay be dependent on particularities of the relevant distributed ledger or on the participation of third parties on the relevant \nnetwork, in particular on the availability of miners or other processing entities. Delays or failures to execute or settle transactions \nmay potentially result in losses or other adverse effects for the Client.\n- Valuation risk of Crypto Currencies in particular: Crypto Currencies are not typically linked to any national or supranational \ncurrency or to any asset or commodity traded on a regulated market and may be subject to elevated volatility. Market exchange \nrates of Crypto Currencies assets may change between issuance of an instruction for sale or purchase and execution.\nBy trading, transacting, investing and holding positions in Digital Assets, the Client acknowledges and accepts the risks described in this \nDigital Asset Risk Disclosure. Clients that do not understand this Digital Asset Risk Disclosure should retain competent counsel or refrain from \nengaging in activities involving Digital Assets.\nAMINA is not responsible for any loss or damage resulting from the realization of risks specific to Digital Assets that are outside the sphere \nof influence of AMINA or that cannot be attributed to any noncompliance by AMINA with its duties of care pursuant to the GTC, the Custody \nRegulations and any other general or special terms of AMINA, as applicable. Further, AMINA is under no obligation to inform the Client of the \nrealization or possibility of realization of any of the risks described above or any other risks relating to Digital Assets.",

Capitalized terms used, but not otherwise defined, in these Terms and Conditions for Staking \nshall have the meanings ascribed to them in the GTC, the Custody Regulations, the disclosure document Special Risks in Digital Assets \nand any other terms and conditions of AMINA. \n AMINA reserves the right to adjust and amend these Terms and Conditions at any time and to communicate such changes to the Client \nin accordance with the GTC.\nArt. 2 Staking of Digital Assets\n Staking requires miners to lock up and put at risk (stake) a certain amount of Digital Assets associated with a given network to process \ntransactions. The concept of staking comes from the consensus mechanism called \u201cproof of stake\u201d or \u201cPoS\u201d . In contrast to Proof-of-Work \n(PoW), where networks heavily rely on mining to add new blocks to the network, a PoS mechanism produces and validates new blocks \nthrough the process of randomly selecting a validator at regular intervals to create a block based on how much \u201cskin in the game\u201d they \nhave: the higher the stake, the higher the chances for a validator to be selected for block production. Staked Digital Assets are lost if \na miner processes a transaction in a way that is fraudulent or violates the rules of the underlying network. Newer networks like Tezos,  \nPolkadot, Solana, Avalanche, Tron, EOS, Algorand and Cardano use proof-of-stake and Ethereum is in the process of switching to this \nnew scheme. Some networks that use PoS permit other holders of the network\u2019s native Digital Assets to permit miners to use some \namount of such other holders\u2019 Digital Assets for staking. If a miner uses Digital Assets of other holders and is chosen as the validator and \nreceives a reward, the miner will give some of its rewards to such holders whose Digital Assets the miner used. Delegated proof-of-stake \n(DPoS) is an evolution of PoS that disperses the power to validate transactions and create new blocks only to a few nodes that generally \nhave been elected by the holders of the native Digital Assets of the relevant network.\nArt. 3 AMINA Staking Services\n AMINA offers to its Clients the possibility to stake Digital Assets according to the rules of the relevant network and to earn rewards for \nstaking Digital Assets for a certain period according to the rules of the relevant underlying network (collectively and throughout this \ndocument referred to as the \u201cStaking Services\u201d).\n When holding Digital Assets with AMINA the Client may choose to stake certain Digital Assets supported by AMINA for Staking Services. \n Staking Services will be available for selected Digital Assets where staking functionality is available and AMINA decides to offer such \nservices. By requesting Staking Services for Digital Assets held with AMINA, the Client instructs AMINA to stake such Digital Assets  \naccording to the rules of the underlying network. Digital Assets are staked on the Client\u2019s behalf by a third-party staking provider provid-\ning staking services. AMINA excludes any liability for such third-party staking providers to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law.Staking Terms and Conditions and Risk Disclosure\nOctober 2021AMINA Bank AG\nKolinplatz 15 \u2022 6300 Zug \u2022 Switzerland \ninfo@aminagroup.com \u2022 aminagroup.com2\nArt. 4 Staking Rewards\n AMINA will use reasonable efforts to stake any Digital Assets available for Staking Services. If a block of transactions regarding the \nstaked assets is successfully validated, the Client may earn a reward calculated and granted by that Staking Assets\u2019 network according \nto the applicable rules (\u201cStaking Reward\u201d). The reward is determined by the rules of the protocols of the applicable network (\u201cStaking  \nProtocol\u201d). Any rewards from the Staking Protocol for your Staked Digital Assets (minus AMINA\u2019s fees) will be distributed to you by  \ncrediting the respective staking account with AMINA. \n The Client has no right to rewards until it is received by AMINA accordingly. The timing of such remittance to the Client and the percent -\nage is in AMINA\u2019s full discretion. All applicable fees as available and agreed in the Pricing Schedule will be deducted from the Staking \nRewards. AMINA does not provide any warranty or guarantee that you will receive Staking Rewards, any specific percentage or type \nStaking Rewards, or any staking return over time, including stated potential Staking Rewards.\n Any information regarding potential Staking Rewards are estimates only that may be changed by AMINA at any time in its sole discre-\ntion. The actual Staking Rewards may be more or less than the Staking Rewards AMINA receives from the third-party staking provider of \na Staking Protocol.\n Some networks subject staked assets to \u201cslashing\u201d if the transaction validator representing those assets incorrectly validates a transac-\ntion (sees Slashing Penalty below). AMINA will use commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that your staked Digital Assets will not be \nslashed, but in the unlikely event they are, you may lose part or all of your staked Digital Assets. AMINA is under no obligation to replace \nany Digital Assets subject to slashing and excludes all liabilities to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law.\nArt. 5 Lockup Period\n Some staked Digital Assets may be subject to a lockup period. AMINA has no control over the duration of or end date for the lockup \nperiod, which will ultimately be determined by the respective protocol. Unlike other Staking Services provided by AMINA, you will be \nunable to opt out of staking of certain Digital Assets once you have staked your assets. AMINA will not refund or replace such Digital \nAssets you wish to unstake. Unless otherwise stated by AMINA, you will not be able to trade, transfer or otherwise access your staked \nDigital Assets during the lockup period. Please refer to the Staking Factsheet which is updated in AMINA\u2019s discretion from time to time \nfor specific lockup periods.\nArt. 6 Governance\n Some of the Staking Protocols include governance and voting mechanisms. In this type of governance, rules for instituting changes \nare encoded into the network protocol. Changes are proposed through code updates, and each staking node operator votes on the  \nproposed changes.\n The Client acknowledges and agrees that AMINA may exercise any such governance decision and/or voting right on the Client\u2019s behalf, \nand you have no rights whatsoever in regard to the governance decisions derived from the staked Digital Assets.\nArt. 7 Tax Treatment\n The tax treatment of Staking Rewards is uncertain, and it is your responsibility to determine what taxes if any, arise from using the  \nStaking Services. You are solely responsible for reporting and paying any applicable taxes arising from staking through the Staking  \nServices and all related transactions (e.g., any exchange or sale of your staked Digital Assets), and acknowledge that AMINA does \nnot provide investment, legal, or tax advice to you in connection with such election to participate. You should conduct your own due \ndiligence and consult your advisors before making any investment decision including whether to participate in staking and related \ntransactions.\nArt. 8 Staking Risks\n Apart from the general risks associated with Digital Assets as described in the document \u201cSpecial Risks in Digital Assets\u201d , Staking \nServices involve some specific risks as outlined below. In addition to the outlined risks, there are risks associated with staking Digital \nAssets including those that AMINA cannot anticipate or foresee. Such risks may further materialize as unanticipated variations or com-\nbinations of the risks discussed in these Staking Terms and Conditions or other risks. The Client agrees and acknowledges all such risks \nassociated with the staking of Digital Assets with the acceptance of these Staking Terms and Conditions.\n a) Slashing Penalty\n Each Staking Protocol may determine penalties for certain events associated with the staking of Staking Assets (e.g. unavailability, \nslow, incorrect or malicious performance) (\u201cSlashing Penalty\u201d). This may occur if a Staking Service has been erroneously operated, the \ntransaction validator incorrectly validated a transaction and/or in any other case determined by the Staking Protocol, that may result \nin a Slashing Penalty, non-payment of the Staking Reward and/or partial or complete loss of staked assets.\n b) Critical Bugs\n Staking Services are based on various Staking Protocols and may require the transfer of Digital Assets into smart contracts on the  \nunderlying network that are not under anyone\u2019s control. As such, any malfunction, unintended function or unexpected functioning \nof the Staking Protocols and/or \u2019 staking assets\u2019 networks may consequently cause Staking Services to malfunction or function in an  \nunexpected or unintended manner.\n Hackers and other groups or organizations may attempt to interfere with Staking Protocols, Staking Services and Staked Assets in any \nnumber of ways, including, without limitation, denial of service attacks, sybil attacks, spoofing, smurfing, malware attacks or consen-\nsus-based attacks.\n Critical bugs including, but not limited to, the ones described above may result in a loss of part or all Staked Assets.AMINA Bank AG\nKolinplatz 15 \u2022 6300 Zug \u2022 Switzerland \ninfo@aminagroup.com \u2022 aminagroup.com3\nArt. 9 No guarantee, representation or warranty\n The Client agrees and acknowledges that AMINA does not provide any guarantee or warranty that the Client will receive any Staking \nRewards. Furthermore, the applicable percentage of the Staking Rewards is an estimate only and does not constitute a guarantee, \nwarranty or representation of any sort and that this may change at any time in AMINA\u2019s full discretion and may be less than the actual \nStaking Rewards AMINA receives from the Staking Protocol. \n AMINA makes no representations, warranties or guarantees that any particular Digital Assets will be available for staking continuously.  \nAMINA has the right to initiate or terminate Staking Services for any Digital Assets or modify the terms and conditions of Staking  \nServices at its sole discretion.\n AMINA uses best effort to ensure that the Staking Services are accessible without interruptions. Notwithstanding the foregoing, AMINA \ncannot guarantee or provide any warranty for an uninterrupted or error-free operation of the Staking Services. The Client acknowledges \nand agrees that in the event of such disruptions the staked assets may not generate any Staking Reward.\nArt. 10 Limitation of Liability\n AMINA\u2019s obligation towards the Client consists in the due performance of its services and contractual duties in accordance with the \nstandard of care customary in Swiss banking practice or as otherwise specified in these Terms and Conditions for Staking, the Custody \nRegulations and/or the GTC.\n Any liability of AMINA for any loss or damage suffered in the absence of any breach by AMINA of its applicable duty of care is excluded. \nIn addition, the liability is also excluded (regardless of any breach of the applicable duty of care) where explicitly stated in these Terms \nand Conditions for Staking. In the event of a loss or damage due to a breach by AMINA of its applicable duty of care, AMINA shall only \nbe liable for direct losses caused with intent or gross negligence. Any liability of AMINA for indirect or consequential losses (including \nloss of profit, loss of data, loss of revenue, or missing of other opportunities) is excluded.\n AMINA is not liable for any loss or damage due to events or the materialization of risks outside its sphere of influence nor for any loss or \ndamage caused or increased by the Client, in particular due to any failure on the part of the Client to take measures to avoid, mitigate \nor reduce any loss or damage.\nArt. 11 Acceptance of Terms and Conditions\n By using AMINA\u2019s Staking Services, the Client acknowledges and accepts the risks described in the Terms and Conditions for Staking \nand agrees to comply with the Terms and Conditions for Staking. Clients that do not understand the Terms and Conditions for Staking \nshould retain competent counsel or refrain from engaging in activities involving Staking Services.\n The Client is required to study and acknowledge the Terms and Conditions for Staking before using the Staking Services and shall take \ninto account the risk factors disclosed herein in its decision-making process, in addition to the risks described in this Digital Asset Risk \nDisclosure. \n Furthermore, these Terms and Conditions for Staking do not discuss any matters of taxation or other legal matters in any jurisdiction \nrelating to the Staking Services. The Client is advised to retain appropriate counsel in respect of legal and tax matters.\n AMINA is not responsible for any loss or damage resulting from the realization of risks specific to the Staking Services that are outside \nthe sphere of influence of AMINA or that cannot be attributed to any non-compliance by AMINA with its duties of care according to the \nGTC, the Custody Regulations and any other general or special terms of AMINA, as applicable. Further, AMINA is under no obligation to \ninform the Client of the realization or possibility of realization of any of the risks described above or any other risks relating to the Staking \nServices.",

The \nClient shall follow any security recommendations of AMINA in connection with identification methods, services, and products.\nArt. 3 Execution of instructions and orders; acceptance of funds and assets\n AMINA may in its discretion decide on the acceptance and execution of orders or instructions issued by the Client or its authorized \nrepresentative and on the acceptance for the account of the Client of assets for deposit or trading, or of amounts to be credited to \nan account of the Client, and may, without giving any reason, refuse acceptance or execution, or reject, refuse or return, in full or in \npart, any assets or amounts received, in particular if it considers the relevant transactions or circumstances unusual or if it identifies or \nsuspects any infringement of, or otherwise to ensure compliance with, legal and regulatory requirements, standards of self-regulation, \ncontractual provisions, business or trade practices or internal rules and policies of AMINA.\n If the Client or its authorized representative issues one or several orders or instructions that, individually or in the aggregate, exceed the \nClient\u2019s credit balances or limits granted by AMINA, AMINA is entitled, at its discretion and irrespective of the date or time the orders or \ninstructions are issued or received, to decide if and to which extent individual orders or instructions are executed in full or in part.\n With regard to Digital Assets in particular, AMINA may, further to the above, in its discretion refuse the execution of orders or instruc-\ntions, or reject, refuse or return, in full or in part, immediately or following a waiting period determined by AMINA in its discretion, any \nincoming or outgoing Digital Assets, or decline to provide to the Client a digital ledger address for the deposit of such Digital Assets, in \nparticular in the following cases:\n(a) where the Client transfers or attempts to transfer the Digital Assets from or to a non-AMINA issued digital ledger address or from \nor to a digital ledger address belonging to a third party;\n(b) where AMINA identifies in its sole discretion any indications that the Digital Assets, the digital ledge address from or to which \nthe Client transfers or attempts to transfer the Digital Assets, or any digital ledger address in the chain leading to such address, \nare associated with any illegal, illicit, or irrational behavior, without limitation in light of any laws or regulations, standards of \nself-regulation, business or trade practices or internal rules and policies of AMINA;\n(c) where the Digital Assets are of a type or category that AMINA does not accept (including pursuant to the custody regulations  \nof AMINA; \u201cCustody Regulations\u201d) or the acceptance of which is limited pursuant to the internal rules and policies of AMINA. \n The Client shall notify AMINA in due time in advance of any digital ledger addresses relevant for deposits or transactions.

If the Client fails to do so, or if such adverse consequences cannot be \navoided by AMINA applying Due Care, such further loss or damage shall be borne by the Client.AMINA Bank AG\nKolinplatz 15 \u2022 6300 Zug \u2022 Switzerland \ninfo@aminagroup.com \u2022 aminagroup.com2\nArt. 4 Statements\n AMINA issues account statements to the Client at least on an annual basis or in the applicable intervals agreed with the Client.\nArt. 5 Complaints and objections\n The Client shall lodge any complaints in respect of defective or delayed execution or non-execution of transactions, or in respect of any \nstatements or other communications from AMINA immediately upon receipt by the Client, but no later than within 30 days from the date \nof the relevant transaction receipt, statement or communication. Account and custody account statements as well as statements \nregarding Digital Asset Custody Storage in the meaning of Section II Custody Regulations (Special provisions for the custody storage \nof Digital Assets) are deemed approved if the Client does not submit an objection within 30 days as of the date of the statement.\n The Client shall further give notice to AMINA without delay where any expected communication is not delivered in the appropriate \ntimeframe, or at all.\n Failure of the Client to give notice of a complaint in due time is deemed a breach of the Client\u2019s obligations, including its statutory \nduty to minimize losses, and the Client shall bear any loss or damage resulting therefrom.\nArt. 6 Interest, charges, commissions, expenses and taxes\n AMINA is entitled to credit or debit any interest, charges (including negative interest), fees, commissions, expenses or taxes agreed \nbetween AMINA and the Client, applicable by law or customary in Swiss banking practice, to an account of the Client.\n Applicable interest rates, charges, commissions, billing cycles and terms are set out in the AMINA pricing schedules, accessible under \nhttps:/ /www.aminagroup.com/legal-notices.

Changes will be communicated to the Client by appropriate means, including as set forth \nin Art. 9 GTC (Use of communications channels; delivery of communications), and will take effect 30 days from the date of notification \nby AMINA unless otherwise specified by AMINA.\nArt. 7 Rights of lien and set-off\n AMINA has a right of lien, for all of its current or future claims against the Client accrued and existing in or in connection with the busi-\nness relationship from time to time, on and with respect to all assets (including without limitation Digital Assets), claims and other rights \nAMINA holds for the account of the Client at any given point in time, whether held by AMINA in its own custody or with third parties, and \non any credit balances or other claims of the Client against AMINA. Such right of lien shall exist irrespective of the type, denomination \n(including in any foreign currencies or Crypto Currencies) or maturity of AMINA\u2019s claims against the Client.\n In an event of default on the part of the Client, AMINA shall be entitled to realize any and all of the assets, claims or other rights over \nwhich it has a lien either by forced or by private sale and including by way of acquisition by AMINA for own account. AMINA may also, \nin its discretion, initiate proceedings for ordinary debt enforcement by way of seizure or bankruptcy proceedings, upholding the lien.\n AMINA has the right to set off any claims the Client may have against AMINA against any claims accruing to AMINA from or in connec-\ntion with its business relationship with the Client, irrespective of the identity of type or denomination (including in any foreign currencies \nor Crypto Currencies) and irrespective of the maturity of such claims. In particular, AMINA shall be entitled to set off even where a claim \nto be set off is not a claim for a particular amount in any currency or Crypto Currency, but for return of an object, asset (including any \nDigital Asset) or security deposited with AMINA or a third-party custodian or is subject to objections.\n If amounts subject to set-off are denominated other than in Swiss Francs or the Client\u2019s reference currency (including in any foreign \ncurrencies or Crypto Currencies), AMINA will convert such amounts in its discretion using a conversion rate selected and deemed rea-\nsonable by it with respect to the relevant date and time.\n AMINA\u2019s rights of lien and set-off shall also apply to any claims of AMINA to be indemnified or held harmless, as well as to any loans and \ncredit facilities of the Client, irrespective of whether or not otherwise secured or collateralized.\nArt. 8 Joint accounts\n An account may be established as a joint account for two or several clients (\u201cJoint Account\u201d).\n Each of the named holders of a Joint Account (a \u201cJoint Account Holder\u201d) shall be entitled individually to operate the relevant Joint  \nAccount, to grant or revoke powers of attorney, to issue orders and instructions to AMINA and generally to dispose of any and all claims, \nassets (including Digital Assets) and other rights on such Joint Account individually with sole signature unless otherwise agreed. AMINA \nis entitled, but not obliged, to require joint instruction by all or several Joint Account Holders in its discretion.\n Powers of attorney granted by one Joint Account Holder are binding upon the other Joint Account Holder(s) and the authorized repre-\nsentatives of one Joint Account Holder are deemed authorized representatives for the other Joint Account Holder(s) unless otherwise \nagreed. In the absence of instructions to the contrary, AMINA is entitled to credit or deposit amounts or assets received for one of the \nJoint Account Holders to the Joint Account.\n Any communications to one of the Joint Account Holders are deemed to have been duly made to all of the Joint Account Holders. \n The Joint Account Holders shall be jointly and severally liable towards AMINA for any obligations arising from or in connection with \nthe Joint Account or their business relationship with AMINA. Furthermore, AMINA shall be entitled to discharge any obligations arising \nfrom or in connection with the Joint Account by performance towards a single Joint Account Holder.AMINA Bank AG\nKolinplatz 15 \u2022 6300 Zug \u2022 Switzerland \ninfo@aminagroup.com \u2022 aminagroup.com3\n In the event of death, declaration of presumed death, bankruptcy or legal incapacity of a Joint Account Holder, and unless AMINA \nreceives instructions to the contrary, the remaining Joint Account Holder(s) and its/their authorized representative(s), if any, shall con-\ntinue(s) to be authorized individually with sole signature as specified above in this Article or shall continue to be authorized as specified \nin the relevant power of attorney. However, upon being notified or otherwise becoming aware of any of the forementioned occurrences, \nAMINA may, in its discretion, suspend or decline the execution of any order or instruction received from the other Joint Account Holder(s) \nor its/their authorized representative(s). AMINA may in such case further request to be furnished with the documentation required or \nconsidered useful by it to determine its duties towards any one or several Joint Account Holder(s).\nArt. 9 Use of communications channels; delivery of communications\n AMINA is permitted to use postal and courier services, telephone, and other voice transmissions as well as electronic means of commu-\nnication (including encrypted or unencrypted e-mail, fax or text messaging, communications through or within digital banking systems \nor mobile applications, and any other electronic channels and platforms) to correspond with the Client or its authorized representatives. \nAMINA may in its discretion contact the Client or its authorized representatives at the physical, electronic or other addresses notified by \nthem to AMINA or at any other addresses previously used by them in communications with AMINA, using the relevant communications \nchannel. AMINA may from time to time agree on specific or preferred communications channels with the Client.\n AMINA is permitted to provide legally relevant information, conditions, and documents to the Client and to fulfil, to the extent admis-\nsible by applicable law, information or disclosure duties (including duties of financial market regulation in connection with investor \nprotection and transparency) vis-\u00e0-vis the Client by way of publication on the Internet (see in particular https:/ /www.aminagroup.com/\nlegal-notices) or other media as AMINA considers appropriate.\n Communications by AMINA are deemed to have been duly transmitted and validly effected upon dispatch by AMINA to any of the \naddresses set forth in the previous paragraph or upon publication on the Internet or other appropriate media, where applicable.\nArt. 10 Communication risk\n The use of any communications channels as permitted to be used by AMINA, in particular unencrypted communications, entails various \nrisks which may result in loss or damage. The same applies to the use of such communications channels by the Client.\n Relevant risks may include the risk of transmission errors in the form of misrouting, loss or delay of messages, mutilations or duplications \nor other irregularities, the risk of interception or manipulation of content, sender data or other message elements by unauthorized third \nparties or the risk of introduction of viruses or other malware. Furthermore, the use of communications channels entails the risk of im-\npairment or lack of confidentiality, in particular that the Client\u2019s business relationship with AMINA and confidential information relating \nthereto might be disclosed to third parties, and, depending on the jurisdictions involved in the transmission, risks in connection with a \nlower level of data protection. The use of unencrypted electronic means of communication or any other unprotected communications \nchannels carries increased risks, including with respect to any of the aforementioned aspects.\n In using any of these communications channels and in handling and processing incoming and outgoing orders, instructions and notifi-\ncations by the Client or its authorized representatives, AMINA applies Due Care and takes customary measures to identify and prevent \nfraudulent activities.\n The Client shall implement and maintain with due care all appropriate security precautions with respect to the communications  \nchannels used with AMINA and furthermore, to protect the devices, systems, software and networks on its end, as applicable, against \nelectronic attacks and unauthorized use. In particular, when issuing orders or instructions to AMINA or engaging in other sensitive or \ntime sensitive communications, the Client shall with due care apply, and cause its authorized representatives to apply, precautionary \nmeasures to address and mitigate the risk of interception, manipulation or other fraudulent activities, including by using communi-\ncations channels with a higher level of protection, and shall verify executed orders, instructions or transactions without delay. Where \nspecific communications channels have been agreed between the Client and AMINA, the Client shall be required to use such commu-\nnications channels pursuant to the agreement with AMINA, and AMINA shall be free, in its discretion, not to accept or to disregard any \ncommunications by the Client through other channels.\n The Client acknowledges and accepts the risks associated with the use of communications channels and agrees to bear any loss or \ndamage that cannot be attributed to noncompliance by AMINA with its duties of care. In particular, the Client shall bear any loss \nor damage resulting from noncompliance with its own duties of care as well as any loss or damage resulting from the realization of \ncommunications risks outside the sphere of influence of AMINA, including in connection with the use of or transmission to, from, or \nvia any device, system, software or network outside of the sphere of influence of AMINA.AMINA Bank AG\nKolinplatz 15 \u2022 6300 Zug \u2022 Switzerland \ninfo@aminagroup.com \u2022 aminagroup.com4\nArt. 11 Accounts in foreign currencies and Crypto Currencies\n AMINA may offer accounts denominated in foreign currencies (i.e. in currencies other than Swiss Francs; \u201cForeign Currency Account(s)\u201d) \nor Crypto Currencies (\u201cCrypto Currency Account(s)\u201d). \n The capitalized term \u201cCrypto Currencies\u201d refers to those types of Digital Assets that (i) are intended or used for payment purposes, and \n(ii) do not qualify as nor represent securities or other financial instruments. AMINA may in its discretion from time to time determine for \nthe purposes of its business relationship with the Client whether it considers a particular Digital Asset a Crypto Currency or not.\n Credit balances on Foreign Currency Accounts or Crypto Currency Accounts constitute a contractual claim of the Client against  \nAMINA for a specific amount denominated in the relevant foreign currency or Crypto Currency. The Client does not have a claim to \nspecific individualized currency units, i.e., for Crypto Currencies in particular, the specific coins, tokens or other units delivered to the \nClient upon withdrawal or transfer may be different from those delivered by the Client, or purchased by the Client for delivery, into a \nCrypto Currency Account, as applicable. AMINA may hold assets corresponding to the Client\u2019s credit balances in the relevant foreign \ncurrencies or Crypto Currencies. With respect to Crypto Currencies in particular, when doing so, AMINA is entitled in its discretion to \ndecide on the form in which it stores the data establishing access to and control over its relevant Crypto Currency positions.\n The Client shall bear all economic and legal consequences (a) of any measures taken by authorities, regulatory or self-regulatory bodies \nin any relevant jurisdiction(s) (including without limitation those where relevant assets are held or invested), or (b) resulting from the exer -\ncise of consensus or similar mechanisms in respect of Crypto Currencies, including without limitation any prohibitions or restrictions of \npayments or transfers, limitations to, suspension or exclusion of convertibility or changes to functionality, which may affect the Client\u2019s \nbalances in the relevant Foreign Currency Account or Crypto Currency Account and/or the corresponding assets held by AMINA, in \neach case with the exception of those economic or legal consequences that are attributable to any non-compliance by AMINA with its \nduties of care.\n AMINA\u2019s obligations arising from Foreign Currency Accounts or Crypto Currency Accounts shall be discharged at the place of business \nof the office at which the accounts are held by establishing a credit balance for the Client at an AMINA branch, a correspondent bank \nor a bank named by the Client in the country of the currency concerned.\n AMINA may in its discretion restrict the amount and/or types of Crypto Currencies that the Client may transfer to and hold on a \nCrypto Currency Account at any given point in time, and is entitled at any time to reduce the Client\u2019s credit balance on any Crypto \nCurrency Account by transferring a corresponding amount of the relevant Crypto Currency into Digital Asset Custody Storage in \nthe meaning of Section II Custody Regulations (Special provisions for the custody storage of Digital Assets) or to refuse, restrict or \nrescind any transfer request by the Client from its Digital Asset Custody Storage to establish or increase a credit balance on a Crypto \nCurrency Account.\n In each case where AMINA in its discretion reduced the Client\u2019s credit balance on any Crypto Currency Account by transferring a  \ncorresponding amount of the relevant Crypto Currency into Digital Asset Custody Storage, it subsequently has the right again to reduce \nthe amount of the relevant Crypto Currency in the Client\u2019s Digital Asset Custody Storage and to increase or re-establish a correspond-\ning credit balance on the Client\u2019s Crypto Currency Account, up to the amount of the credit balance prior to such previous transfer by  \nAMINA.\n AMINA may in its discretion from time to time determine or amend such restrictions on a percentage or other basis and communicate \nthem to the Client by appropriate means, including as set forth in the GTC (see Art. 9 GTC \u2018Use of communications channels; delivery of \ncommunications\u2019).\nArt. 12 Trading in foreign currencies and crypto currencies\n With respect to conversions or trading by the Client in foreign currencies or Crypto Currencies, AMINA may in its discretion act as prin-\ncipal or riskless principal. Unless otherwise specifically agreed with the Client, AMINA does not act as agent or fiduciary in transactions \nregarding foreign currencies or Crypto Currencies.\n As principal, AMINA acts for its own account in its own interest. Prices quoted by AMINA as principal may take into account various \nspecifics of the relevant currencies or Crypto Currencies, the Client\u2019s order, market conditions and inventory and may include a discre-\ntionary mark-up. As riskless principal, AMINA fulfils the Client\u2019s order by simultaneously executing a substantially identical transaction \n(or combination of transactions) with other counterparties, subject to a mark-up and terms agreed in advance between AMINA and the \nClient.\n AMINA has no obligation to accept orders or to enter into transactions regarding foreign currencies or Crypto Currencies and may in its \ndiscretion provide quotes, accept or reject orders without giving any reason.\n AMINA may further specify its pricing, order handling and execution practices regarding conversions or trading in foreign currencies or \nCrypto Currencies in special terms and conditions.\nArt. 13 Crediting and debiting amounts in foreign currencies and crypto currencies\n AMINA is entitled to convert and credit or debit payments or transfers in foreign currencies or Crypto Currencies for which the Client \ndoes not have an account so denominated to the Client\u2019s reference currency account unless the Client has instructed AMINA otherwise \nin due time in advance.\n If the Client holds a correspondingly denominated account in respect of a foreign currency or Crypto Currency payment or transfer, but \nwith an insufficient credit balance, AMINA is entitled, at its discretion, to debit and convert balances on the Client\u2019s reference currency \naccount and/or any other Foreign Currency Account or Crypto Currency Account. \n In the absence of any specific agreement between AMINA and the Client, the reference currency shall be Swiss Francs.AMINA Bank AG\nKolinplatz 15 \u2022 6300 Zug \u2022 Switzerland \ninfo@aminagroup.com \u2022 aminagroup.com5\nArt. 14 Bills of exchange, cheques and similar instruments\n AMINA is entitled, at its discretion, to debit amounts corresponding to bills of exchange, cheques or similar instruments from the Client\u2019s \naccounts where such amounts have previously been credited to the Client in connection with the relevant instrument being redeemed \nor discounted with AMINA, in the event of full or partial non-payment by any parties liable under the relevant instrument.\n Pending the settlement of any outstanding debit balance, AMINA retains a claim to payment of the total amount of the relevant instru-\nment plus related claims against any party liable under the instrument, whether such claims emanate from the instrument or exist on \nany other legal basis.\nArt. 15 Risks of Digital Assets\n Engaging in transactions and holding positions in Digital Assets entails various specific risks which may differ from those applicable \nto traditional financial instruments or national and supranational currencies and which may result in loss or damages. A non-ex -\nhaustive description of crypto specific risks has been provided to the Client in a separate disclosure document Special Risks of Digital \nAssets\u201d , also accessible under https:/ /www.aminagroup.com/legal-notices, which constitutes an integral part of these GTC. AMINA re-\nserves the right to adjust and amend the disclosure document at any time.

General Provisions\nArt. 1 Purpose and scope of application\n These custody regulations (the \u201cCustody Regulations\u201d) govern the custody and administration of claims, property and other assets  \n(the \u201cCustody Assets\u201d) by AMINA Bank AG (\u201cAMINA\u201d) for and on behalf of the client (the \u201cClient) and related matters.\n The Custody Regulations form an integral part of the contractual relationship between the Client and AMINA and apply together with \nand in addition to the general terms and conditions (the \u201cGTC\u201d) and any other terms and conditions of AMINA, subject to any special \nagreements between the Client and AMINA.\nArt. 2 Acceptance of Custody Assets\n AMINA may in particular accept the following types of Custody Assets:\na) Digital Assets, for custody and administration;\nb) securities of all types, for custody and administration;\nc) money market investments, capital market investments and other financial instruments not issued in the form of securities,  \nfor custody and administration;\nd) precious metals and coins with numismatic value, for custody;\ne) documents of title or documents evidencing entitlement, for custody;\nf) valuables and other suitable objects, for custody. \n AMINA shall, as applicable, store the Custody Assets, handle and perform administrative actions or perform any other services regard-\ning the Custody Assets applying Due Care. \n The capitalized term \u201cDigital Assets\u201d refers to digital assets registered on a blockchain or another digital, distributed and encryp-\ntion-based ledger or based on similar technology, including without limitation those qualifying as or representing securities or other \nfinancial instruments. \n The capitalized term \u201cCrypto Currencies\u201d refers to those types of Digital Assets that (i) are intended or used for payment purposes, and \n(ii) do not qualify as nor represent securities or other financial instruments. AMINA may in its discretion from time to time determine for \nthe purposes of its business relationship with the Client whether it considers a particular Digital Asset a Crypto Currency or not.\n As a general principle, with regard to Digital Assets, the terms \u201ccustody\u201d , \u201cholding\u201d , \u201cstorage\u201d and terms with similar meaning refer to the \ngeneration, distribution, administration and/or storage of data establishing access to and control over the Digital Assets, in particular \nas further detailed in the special provisions for the custody storage of Digital Assets in Section II of these Custody Regulations. The Dig-\nital Assets themselves exist on the relevant distributed ledger only and such distributed ledger is outside of the sphere of influence of \nAMINA.\n AMINA may in its discretion, from time to time, decide not to offer or discontinue offering custody, administration or other services for \nand with respect to any of the types of assets listed above, without giving any reason. Furthermore, AMINA may in its discretion refuse \nacceptance of specific assets for custody and/or administration or decline to continue to accept or hold and return or send back, in full \nor in part, any assets without giving any reason, including as further specified, generally and for Digital Assets in particular, in the GTC \n(see Art. 3 GTC \u2018Execution of instructions and orders; acceptance of funds and assets\u2019).\n AMINA may establish and, in its discretion, amend and modify at any time, a list of assets or types of assets acceptable for custody and/\nor administration. Such list and changes thereto will be communicated to the Client by appropriate means, including as set forth in the \nGTC (see Art. 9 GTC \u2018Use of communications channels; delivery of communications\u2019).\n Where Custody Assets are no longer acceptable to AMINA, whether for legal, regulatory, reputational, product-specific or any other \nreasons, AMINA will ask the Client for instructions as to where to transfer such Custody Assets or to provide other suitable instructions, \nsuch as for conversion of the relevant Custody Assets. If the Client, after an appropriate grace period granted by AMINA in its discretion, \nfails to notify AMINA where to transfer the Custody Assets or to provide other suitable instructions, AMINA shall be entitled to either \ndeliver the assets physically to the Client\u2019s last known address at the expense and at the risk of the Client or to liquidate them and to \ndisburse the proceeds in accordance with the GTC (see Art. 26 GTC \u2018Term and termination of the business relationship\u2019).AMINA Bank AG\nKolinplatz 15 \u2022 6300 Zug \u2022 Switzerland \ninfo@aminagroup.com \u2022 aminagroup.com2\nArt. 3 Dematerialized securities\n Book-entry securities, Digital Assets qualifying as or representing securities and other rights or claims not evidenced by a certificate but \nhaving the same function as securities, are treated the same way as securities. In particular, the provisions on commission (Art. 425 et \nseqq. of the Swiss Code of Obligations) apply between the Client and AMINA.\nArt. 4 Examination of assets\n AMINA is entitled to examine assets delivered by the Client or by third parties for the account of the Client, e.g. regarding origin, authen-\nticity or blocking notices, or have a third party custodian or other third party agent in Switzerland or outside of Switzerland perform such \nexamination, including by performing forensic checks and other reviews as considered relevant by AMINA. AMINA is entitled to engage \nin or order any such examinations both prior to and following acceptance of assets into custody, in each case without assuming any lia-\nbility. AMINA shall not be required to perform any administrative actions nor execute any sales and delivery orders or other instructions \nor transactions regarding assets until such time as the examination and any actions resulting therefrom have been completed.\n AMINA conducts the examination of assets in accordance with the resources and documents at its disposal, applying Due Care includ-\ning with respect to the selection and instruction of third party service providers. Any loss or damage resulting from late or non-perfor -\nmance of administrative actions, orders, instructions or transactions in connection with the examination of assets shall be borne by the \nClient unless such loss or damage has arisen due to a breach by AMINA of its applicable duty of care.\nArt. 5 Form of Custody\n Unless agreed otherwise with the Client, AMINA is entitled to hold Custody Assets, or have them held, in collective custody. This does not \napply to the custody of any assets that have to be held separately by nature, by agreement between the Client and AMINA, or for other \nreasons as considered relevant by AMINA.\n Custody Assets subject to drawing by lot may be held in collective custody. Drawn lots are allocated among clients by AMINA using a \nmethod which, to the extent reasonably commercially possible, provides for materially the same chance of inclusion in the secondary \ndrawing as in the primary drawing.\nArt. 6 Third-part custody\n AMINA is entitled to hold Custody Assets with one or several third party custodians of its choice, in Switzerland or abroad. Custody  \nAssets traded exclusively or primarily outside of Switzerland are typically held abroad and, if necessary, shall be transferred there at the \nexpense and risk of the Client.\n In connection with the permitted use of third party custodians, AMINA shall be liable for due selection and instruction only. Neither the \nClient nor its authorised representatives shall have any right of instruction vis-\u00e0-vis the third party custodians used by AMINA.\n If Custody Assets are held with a third party custodian outside of Switzerland, they may be subject to the laws and customary practices \nof its domicile, place of business or other relevant jurisdiction, which may differ from those in Switzerland and may not offer the same \nlevel of rights or protection, in particular in the event of insolvency of the third party custodian. In particular, it may not be possible to \nindividualise and segregate Custody Assets in an insolvency of the third party custodian. Furthermore, third party custodians may assert \nrights of lien, liquidation, retention or set-off in relation to the Custody Assets.\n AMINA only transfers those rights to the Client that it receives from a third party custodian. If applicable laws or regulations, standards \nof self-regulation or contractual provisions make it difficult or impossible for AMINA to return Custody Assets held abroad or to transfer \nthe proceeds from the sale of such Custody Assets, AMINA is only obliged to assign a claim for the return of property or payment of the \nsums involved to the Client, always provided that such claim exists and is assignable.\nArt. 7 Registration of Custody Assets\n AMINA may in its discretion choose to register Custody Assets or hold them with third party custodians (a) in the Client\u2019s name, (b) in its \nown name or in the name of a third party, or (c) without any personal or individualised registration, but in each case for the account of \nand at the expense and risk of the Client. Where applicable, the Client accepts the disclosure of its name and related information to the \nrelevant third parties in accordance with the GTC (see Art. 19 GTC \u2018Bank client confidentiality\u2019 and Art. 20 GTC \u2018Data protection\u2019).\nArt. 8 Administration\n Unless the Client provides specific instructions, AMINA performs the standard administrative actions customary in Swiss banking prac-\ntice. Depending on the type of Custody Asset, such standard administrative actions may include, without limitation:\na) collecting interest, dividends and principal amounts as well as any other distributions due for payment.\nb) monitoring drawings as well as redemption, conversion, subscription and similar rights using available sources of information \ncustomary in Swiss banking practice.\nc) effecting residual payments in respect of financial instruments that are not fully paid in, if a due date has been specified.\n Where AMINA credits distributions to the Client\u2019s account before they are received, it reserves the right to reverse these credits should \nsuch distributions fail to arrive with AMINA. Distributions credited in error or reversed may be cancelled at any time.\n AMINA performs other administrative actions such as the exercise, purchase or sale of subscription rights, the exercise of conversion \nand option rights, accepting or declining public takeover bids and similar actions only upon instruction of the Client. If instructions are \nnot received in due time, AMINA has the right, but not the obligation, to proceed as it deems appropriate (including by debiting the \nClient\u2019s account as required).AMINA Bank AG\nKolinplatz 15 \u2022 6300 Zug \u2022 Switzerland \ninfo@aminagroup.com \u2022 aminagroup.com3\n AMINA does not perform any administrative acts in respect of insurance policies, mortgage deeds and items in closed custody or of \nCustody Assets which are primarily traded abroad but are exceptionally held in custody in Switzerland.\n Digital Assets of the Client held in custody with AMINA are subject to technology-specific and other particularities, limitations and  \ndevelopments, and may be affected by various events requiring administrative actions. AMINA is entitled, but not required, to review \nsuch events in each individual case (taking into account materiality and other aspects which AMINA in its discretion considers relevant), \nor have a third party agent in Switzerland or outside of Switzerland perform such review, and to proceed in its discretion, in particular as \nfollows (regarding terminology, see e.g. the glossary in the AMINA document \u201cSpecial Risks of Digital Assets\u201d):\na) In the event of a hard fork affecting the underlying distributed ledger of the relevant Digital Asset, AMINA may decide in its \ndiscretion on whether or not to support either of the forked chains or any Digital Asset(s) newly created by or in connection with \nsuch event and to take the appropriate administrative actions. In particular, AMINA may decide not to support newly created \nDigital Assets or to support their withdrawal only, but not to accept them for custody. In the latter case, the Client will be  \nrequired to provide suitable transfer instructions to AMINA.\nb) In the event of an airdrop of Digital Assets to a digital ledger address of the Client, AMINA may decide in its discretion on  \nwhether or not to support the airdrop (e.g. by making the airdropped Digital Assets visible, including them in Client statements  \nor enabling disposal by the Client over such Digital Assets within or using AMINA\u2019s systems) and to take the appropriate  \nadministrative actions. If an airdrop is not supported, AMINA may require the Client to provide suitable transfer or other  \ninstructions to AMINA.\n AMINA is under no obligation to inform the Client about hard forks, airdrops or similar events. By default, if AMINA in its discretion does \nnot engage in a review of any such event or does not reach a decision, such event and any newly created or airdropped Digital Assets \nare not supported by AMINA.\n Withdrawal of newly created or airdropped Digital Assets and other administrative actions in connection with a hard fork, airdrop or \nsimilar event may be subject to specific deadlines, waiting periods or other limitations as determined and communicated to the Client \nby AMINA in its discretion or existing for technological or other reasons outside the sphere of influence of AMINA. AMINA is, in particular, \nnot liable for any loss or damage caused by the Client\u2019s non-compliance with any such timeframes or with AMINA\u2019s instructions.\n Depending on the consensus mechanism and other elements of the underlying distributed ledger of Digital Assets, the Client may  \nbecome entitled to rewards or other benefits deriving from the size, nature or other aspects of its own position in such Digital Assets \nheld in custody with AMINA. In such case, and with respect to other passive income elements relating to Digital Assets of the Client held \nin custody with AMINA, AMINA applies reasonable efforts to collect and credit such benefits or passive income elements to the Client.\n AMINA is entitled, in its discretion, to determine and amend the scope and limitations of standard administrative actions and other  \nadministrative actions regarding Custody Assets at any time. Such information will be communicated to the Client by appropriate \nmeans, including as set forth in the GTC (see Art. 9 GTC \u2018Use of communications channels; delivery of communications\u2019).\n It is the responsibility of the Client to take all other measures to preserve the rights associated with its Custody Assets, including without \nlimitation by issuing timely instructions to AMINA and by enforcing any rights in connection with Custody Assets in legal or insolvency \nproceedings, and to obtain the necessary information to be able to do so.\nArt. 9 Orders\n The Client may instruct AMINA to place orders, such as purchases, sales, subscriptions, conversions or redemptions, or to perform trans-\nfers of Digital Assets, securities or other financial instruments, whether listed on any trading venue or not, in each case subject, in par -\nticular, to the GTC (see in particular Art. 3 GTC \u2018Execution of instructions and orders; acceptance of funds and assets\u2019). The Client shall \nbe fully responsible for the investment decisions leading to an order and it acknowledges and accepts that transactions so instructed \nare at its own risk and expense.\n AMINA provides access to Digital Assets, securities or other financial instruments to the Client subject to the provisions of these Custo-\ndy Regulations and compliance with applicable laws, regulations and standards of self-regulation, contractual provisions, business or \ntrade practices or internal rules and policies of AMINA. It may limit or exclude such access, or refuse, limit or condition the performance \nof transfers, with respect to individual financial instruments, types or classes of financial instruments at any time in its discretion without \ngiving any reason.\n AMINA applies Due Care in executing transactions for the account of the Client, but does not guarantee execution or execution within a \nparticular timeframe. The time periods for execution of individual transactions may vary depending on the form of custody, market con-\nditions (including, with respect to Digital Assets, around specific expected or unexpected events such as forks affecting the underlying \ndistributed ledger), compliance requirements, technological and various other external factors. In particular, the Client acknowledges \nthat the execution of orders or instructions may be dependent on the trading days/times of involved trading venues or platforms, if any.\n With regard to orders regarding Digital Assets in particular, the Client acknowledges and accepts the specific risks detailed in AMINA\u2019s \nseparate disclosure document (\u201cSpecial Risks of Digital Assets\u201d), as amended from time to time.\n Any orders to transfer Digital Assets or any other instructions for transactions concerning Digital Assets have to be placed by the Client \nwith AMINA with sufficient advance notice taking into account the current form of custody of the relevant Digital Assets. Further de-\ntails and minimum average transfer times are set out in AMINA\u2019s separate Digital Asset custody storage product description \u201cAMINA  \nSolutions Custody Storage Description\u201d accessible under https:/ /www.aminagroup.com/legal-notices.AMINA Bank AG\nKolinplatz 15 \u2022 6300 Zug \u2022 Switzerland \ninfo@aminagroup.com \u2022 aminagroup.com4\nArt. 10 Statements\n AMINA issues a statement of Custody Assets to the Client at least on an annual basis or in the applicable intervals agreed with the \nClient. Valuations of Custody Assets are based on non-binding, approximate rates obtained from available sources of information  \ncustomary in Swiss banking practice or, where no such custom has been established, reasonably selected by AMINA in its discretion.\nArt. 11 Cancellation of certificates\n AMINA is entitled to cancel certificates that have been deposited and replace them with uncertificated securities or other instruments \nto the extent permitted under applicable laws, regulations and standards of self-regulation.\nArt. 12 Reporting requirements\n The Client shall be responsible for complying with any reporting requirements applicable to or associated with the Custody Assets, in \nparticular vis-\u00e0-vis issuers, affiliates and other companies, trading venues and other financial market infrastructures, authorities and \nother third parties, even if the Custody Assets are not registered in the name of the Client. AMINA is under no obligation to advise the \nClient of any such reporting requirements.\n AMINA is entitled to refrain from performing any or all administrative actions in respect of Custody Assets if and to the extent they give \nrise to a reporting obligation on the part of AMINA. AMINA will inform the Client accordingly, subject to applicable laws prohibiting such \ninformation.\nArt. 13 Delivery and disposal of the Custody Assets\n The Client may at any time request that the Custody Assets be delivered to it or put at its disposal. AMINA shall perform such request \nin the form and within the time period customary in Swiss banking practice and corresponding to the type of Custody Assets, or, where \nno such custom has been established, in the form and within the time period reasonably determined by AMINA in its discretion, in each \ncase in accordance with and subject to any applicable notice or waiting periods, legal, regulatory or self-regulatory requirements, con-\ntractual provisions, business or trade practices, internal rules and policies of AMINA, or requirements stipulated in the issuer\u2019s corporate \ndocuments, as well as subject to any rights of lien, rights of retention or other withholding rights of AMINA or other agreements. For \nDigital Assets in particular, AMINA reserves the right to effect delivery only to verified digital ledger addresses of the Client.\n The Client is required to provide AMINA with all information required or considered useful by AMINA to comply with any request for \ndelivery of Custody Assets. If the Client fails to do so, any loss or damage resulting from late delivery or non- delivery of Custody Assets \nshall be borne by the Client.\nII. Special provisions for the custody storage of Digital Assets\n In addition to, and, where applicable, derogating, the provisions of Sections I and III Custody Regulations, the acceptance, custody and \nadministration by AMINA of Digital Assets in specific, segregated storage (\u201cDigital Asset Custody Storage\u201d) is governed by this Section \nII Custody Regulations.\nArt. 14 Common terms regarding Digital Asset Custody Storage and measures taken by AMINA\n Digital Asset Custody Storage is established and maintained on a per-client segregated basis, i.e. the Client is issued an individual  \ndigital ledger address that is processed and administrated by AMINA as further specified in these Custody Regulations, or Digital Assets \nCustody Storage may be established in pools, provided that the segregation takes place internally and thus, the allocation of the digital \nassets to the individual customers is identifiable internally, i.e. which share of the pool is attributable to the individual customer (e.g. with \nthe use of the core banking system).\n As a general principle, \u201ccustody\u201d , \u201cholding\u201d or \u201cstorage\u201d (or terms with similar meaning) of Digital Assets with AMINA consists in gen-\nerating, distributing, administrating and/or storing such data as is required to establish access to and enabling the disposition over \naddresses in a blockchain or another digital, distributed and encryption based ledger that contain, represent or are associated with the \nrelevant Digital Assets of the Client. This includes the creation of digital ledger addresses and the storage of private keys, passwords \nor seeds in any of the forms listed in Art. 15 Custody Regulations (Forms of custody). The relevant distributed ledgers themselves and \nany data stored therein, including without limitation the Digital Assets as such or any references thereto, are, unless explicitly specified \notherwise, not operated nor controlled by AMINA and therefore outside of the sphere of influence of AMINA.\n AMINA establishes and stores the relevant data for Digital Asset Custody Storage applying Due Care. Furthermore, AMINA takes  \ncommercially reasonable measures to identify and mitigate the potential for materialization of risks associated with Digital Assets. Such \nrisks include without limitation the following:\na) hacking and other attacks by third parties, in particular with respect to data establishing access to and enabling the disposition \nover Digital Assets, or individual transactions in Digital Assets;\nb) data theft, including hardware theft by physical intrusion;\nc) loss of data;\nd) internal or external fraudulent activities.AMINA Bank AG\nKolinplatz 15 \u2022 6300 Zug \u2022 Switzerland \ninfo@aminagroup.com \u2022 aminagroup.com5\n The measures taken by AMINA are described and explained in more detail for each of the relevant forms of custody in AMINA\u2019s  \nseparate Digital Asset Custody Storage product description \u201cAMINA Solutions Custody Storage Description\u201d , accessible under https:/ /\nwww.aminagroup.com/legal-notices.\n AMINA reserves the right to adjust and amend the \u201cAMINA Solutions Custody Storage Description\u201d at any time, including due to chang-\nes in technology and market practices. Changes will be communicated to the Client by appropriate means, including as set forth in the \nGTC (see Art. 9 GTC \u2018Use of communications channels; delivery of communications\u2019).\n Where not specified otherwise herein, AMINA\u2019s obligation towards the Client in connection with Digital Asset Custody Storage consists \nin and is limited to due performance in accordance with the standard of Due Care and taking the measures specified in the Digital Asset \nCustody Storage product description \u201cAMINA Solutions Custody Storage Description\u201d . AMINA does not warrant nor guarantee in any \nform the integrity of the Digital Assets in Digital Asset Custody Storage with AMINA. The Client acknowledges and accepts the risks \nassociated with Digital Asset Custody Storage and agrees to bear any loss or damage that cannot be attributed to non-compliance \nby AMINA with its duties of care. In particular, the Client shall bear any loss or damage resulting from non-compliance with its own \nduties of care as well as any other loss or damage resulting from events or the materialization of risks outside the sphere of influence of  \nAMINA, including without limitation any hacking, intrusions or other attacks by third parties targeting any elements outside the sphere \nof influence of AMINA, such as the external systems, nodes or other physical or virtual elements of blockchains, digital, distributed and \nencryption ledgers or other databases not operated of AMINA, or individual addresses within such databases, as may be relevant to the \nexistence, access to or disposition over the Digital Assets of the Client.\n The Client shall be required to cooperate with AMINA as required or deemed useful by AMINA to address and mitigate the risks in  \nconnection with Digital Asset Custody Storage. In particular, the Client shall under no circumstances communicate or pass on any  \ndigital ledger addresses provided to it by AMINA in connection with Digital Assets held in custody to any other person or third party with \nthe exception of its authorized representatives 1. Any costs associated with the creation of new digital ledger addresses and transfers \nof Digital Assets in connection with a violation by the Client of such duty shall be borne by the Client.\nArt. 15 Forms of Custody\n Digital Asset Custody Storage may take the following forms:\na) hot storage;\nb) cold storage;\nc) deep cold storage.\n In the absence of any specific request by the Client, AMINA will hold Digital Assets of the Client in hot storage.\n Any instructions to transfer Digital Assets into Digital Asset Custody Storage or from one form of Digital Asset Custody Storage into  \nanother must be communicated by the Client to AMINA in accordance with Art. 9 Custody Regulations (Orders). Such transfers are \nsubject to acceptance by AMINA in its discretion and AMINA may refuse or reverse such transfers without giving any reason. AMINA \nmay further in its discretion from time to time make available, restrict or refuse specific forms of Digital Asset Custody Storage and may \ncommunicate such restrictions to the Client by appropriate means, including as set forth in the GTC; see Art. 9 GTC (Use of communi-\ncations channels; delivery of communications).\n For purposes of short term trading in a Crypto Currency, AMINA may require the Client to establish a Crypto Currency Account with \nAMINA in the meaning of Art. 11 GTC (Accounts in foreign currencies and Crypto Currencies) and to maintain a credit balance on such \nCrypto Currency Account in the amount required for the intended trading activities. For clarity, credit balances on a Crypto Currency \nAccount constitute a contractual claim of the Client against AMINA and do not refer to any Crypto Currencies held in Digital Asset \nCustody Storage for the Client on a segregated basis pursuant to these Custody Regulations.\nArt. 16 Hot Storage\n HSM and multi-party computation (MPC) systems that are connected to the Internet or other public networks for the purpose of storing \nthe private keys enabling the access to and disposition over the relevant digital ledger addresses for the Digital Assets of the Client. \nAMINA may operate the hardware used for hot storage itself or outsource such operation to third parties in accordance with the GTC  \n(see Art. 18 GTC \u2018Outsourcing\u2019).\n AMINA issues a digital ledger address to the Client to be used for transfers of Digital Assets into hot storage. Transactions concerning \nDigital Assets in hot storage require digital signatures by at least three AMINA operators, subject to exceptions for transactions in minor \namounts as determined by AMINA from time to time in its discretion and communicated to the Client by appropriate means, including \nas set forth in the GTC (see Art. 9 GTC \u2018Use of communications channels; delivery of communications\u2019).\nArt. 17 Cold Storage\n Cold storage refers to the use of computers that are not connected in any form to the Internet or any other networks and that are \ntempest-shielded as well as located in monitored and access-controlled facilities for the purpose of administrating the private keys \nenabling the access to and disposition over the relevant digital ledger addresses for the Digital Assets of the Client.\n AMINA issues a digital ledger address to the Client for each type of Digital Asset to be used for transfers of Digital Assets into cold  \nstorage. Transactions concerning Digital Assets in cold storage require digital signatures by at least three AMINA operators, subject \nto exceptions for transactions in minor amounts as determined by AMINA from time to time in its discretion and communicated to the \nClient by appropriate means, including as set forth in the GTC (see Art. 9 GTC \u2018Use of communications channels; delivery of communi-\ncations\u2019).

Transactions concerning Digital Assets in deep cold storage require digital signatures by at least three AMINA operators that \nare randomly selected for each individual transaction, subject to exceptions for transactions in minor amounts as determined by AMINA \nfrom time to time in its discretion and communicated to the Client by appropriate means, including as set forth in the GTC (see Art. 9 \nGTC \u2018Use of communications channels; delivery of communications\u2019). At the request of the Client, further required external action and \nsignatures can be defined.\nIII. Miscellaneous provisions \nArt. 19 Fees and remuneration\n AMINA is entitled to credit or debit any custody, administration or transaction fees agreed between AMINA and the Client, applicable \nby law or customary in Swiss banking practice, to an account of the Client.\n Applicable fees for the custody and/or administration of Custody Assets, as well as any related services or transactions, are set out in \nthe AMINA pricing schedules, accessible under https:/ /www.aminagroup.com/legal-notices.\n AMINA reserves the right to adjust and amend the fee schedules at any time, including due to changes in market conditions or costs. \nChanges will be communicated to the Client by appropriate means including as set forth in the GTC (see Art. 9 GTC \u2018Use of commu-\nnications channels; delivery of communications\u2019) and will take effect 30 days from the date of notification by AMINA unless otherwise \nspecified by AMINA.\n Distribution fees, inducements or other monetary and/or non-monetary benefits such as sales commissions, trailer fees, acquisition \ncommissions, rebates or similar arrangements as AMINA may receive or benefit from or grant to third parties (including affiliates of \nAMINA) in connection with its business relationship with the Client are handled, and may be retained, by AMINA in accordance with the \nGTC (see Art. 21 GTC \u2018Distribution fees and other benefits\u2019).\nArt. 20 Joint custody accounts\n Custody accounts (for Custody Assets other than Digital Assets) as well as Digital Asset Custody Storage with AMINA may be estab-\nlished as a joint account for two or several clients.

General Provisions\nArt. 1 Purpose and scope of application\n These special terms and conditions for trading in foreign currencies and crypto currencies (\u201cForex and Crypto Trading Terms\u201d)  \ngovern any orders for conversions or account transfers and trading by the client (\u201cClient) with AMINA Bank AG (\u201cAMINA\u201d) in, from or into  \nforeign currencies (i.e. currencies other than Swiss Francs) or Crypto Currencies (as defined in the general terms and conditions of  \nAMINA; \u201cGTC\u201d), and specify how AMINA prices, handles and executes such transactions.\n The Forex and Crypto Trading Terms form an integral part of the contractual relationship between the Client and AMINA and apply \ntogether with and in addition to the GTC and any other terms and conditions of AMINA, subject to any special agreements between the \nClient and AMINA and subject to any separate regulations of AMINA for specific platforms or communications channels, including with \nregard to digital banking systems or mobile applications, or for special types of trading.\n The Forex and Crypto Trading Terms do not apply to trading in Digital Assets other than Crypto Currencies (each as defined in the GTC).\nArt. 2 Trading Channels\n The Client may convert and trade in foreign currencies and Crypto Currencies, and issue any orders and instructions to AMINA in this \nregard:\na) through the AMINA digital banking system; or\nb) by telephone, either through the client relationship manager competent for the Client or by direct access to the AMINA trading \ndesk, subject to the conclusion of a direct access agreement between AMINA and the Client; or \nc) using specific electronic trading channels and tools as may be offered by AMINA from time to time, subject to the conclusion  \nof appropriate service agreements between AMINA and the Client.\n The eligibility of the Client to access or use any particular trading channel is at the discretion of AMINA. AMINA is not required to receive  \nor accept any orders or instructions of the Client by any communications or transmission channels other than those listed above  \n(including without limitation by e-mail, text message or in writing), and any orders or instructions by such other channels shall be deemed \nrefused without any notice or other action by AMINA unless explicitly accepted in the individual case in AMINA\u2019s discretion.\nArt. 3 Range of Currencies\n AMINA determines the range of foreign currencies or Crypto Currencies available to the Client for conversion or trading in its discretion. \nIn particular, AMINA may from time to time decide not to offer or to discontinue or limit the conversion or trading in specific foreign \ncurrencies or Crypto Currencies without giving any reason, even if the Client still holds positions in such currencies.\n AMINA may establish and, in its discretion, amend and modify at any time, a list of foreign currencies or Crypto Currencies available for \nconversion or trading. Such list and changes thereto will be communicated to the Client by appropriate means, including as set forth in \nArt. 9 GTC (Use of communications channels; delivery of communications).\nArt. 4 General Prerequisites for Trading\n The Client requires an account with AMINA for each of the foreign currencies or Crypto Currencies between which it wishes to perform \nconversions or account transfers or in which it wishes to trade, subject in particular to the provisions of the GTC on Foreign Currency \nAccount(s) and Crypto Currency Account(s) (see in particular Art. 11 GTC \u201cAccounts in foreign currencies and Crypto Currencies\u201d and \nArt. 13 GTC \u201cCrediting and debiting amounts in foreign currencies and Crypto Currencies\u201d\n For Crypto Currencies in particular, only credit balances or limits granted by AMINA on Crypto Currency Accounts (as defined in the \nGTC) are eligible for trading purposes. Crypto Currencies held in Digital Asset Custody Storage (as defined in the custody regulations of \nAMINA; \u201cCustody Regulations\u201d) cannot be used for trading pursuant to these Forex and Crypto Trading Terms.AMINA Bank AG\nKolinplatz 15 \u2022 6300 Zug \u2022 Switzerland \ninfo@aminagroup.com \u2022 aminagroup.com2\nArt. 5 Availability and hours of operations\n AMINA is free to determine, adjust and amend at any time the hours of operations and cut-off times in respect of each available trading \nchannel, as well as any minimum, incremental and maximum transaction amounts, availability of order types or applicable trading rules. \nAMINA may communicate any such parameters, requirements or limitations, if applicable, to the Client as it considers appropriate, \nincluding with respect to individual orders or transactions or in general form and in each case as set forth in Art. 9 GTC \u201cUse of commu-\nnications channels; delivery of communications\u201d .\n In operating and maintaining its systems relevant to the provision of conversion and trading services to the Client, AMINA applies Due \nCare. AMINA is not responsible for any persons or systems outside its sphere of influence and, in particular, does not warrant or guaran-\ntee in any form the availability of services or of specific trading channels.\n AMINA may at any time, whether for legal, regulatory, reputational, technical, market- or currency-specific or for any other reasons, limit \nor cancel the Client\u2019s ability to perform conversions or trade in foreign currencies or Crypto Currencies, limit or cancel the use of any of \nAMINA\u2019s trading channels or refuse to execute the Client\u2019s orders, without giving any reason.\nArt. 6 AMINA as Counterparty\n All transactions with the Client regarding foreign currencies or Crypto Currencies are made and entered into by AMINA as principal,  \ni.e. as counterparty to the Client in the capacity of seller or buyer, as the case may be. In particular, unless otherwise agreed or spec-\nified, AMINA does not act as broker, agent, intermediary or otherwise in a fiduciary capacity for or on behalf of the Client in such \ntransactions.\n AMINA may in its discretion act as principal or riskless principal vis-\u00e0-vis the Client, as further specified herein, in particular with respect \nto pricing, order handling and execution.\n As principal, AMINA acts for its own account and benefit on an arm\u2019s length basis. As riskless principal, AMINA fulfils the Client\u2019s order \nby simultaneously executing an identical transaction (or combination of transactions) with other counterparties.\n AMINA\u2019s interests in trading in foreign currencies or Crypto Currencies may run contrary to or otherwise conflict with those of the \nClient. By trading with AMINA, the Client acknowledges AMINA\u2019s role as principal and counterparty and the potential conflicts of \ninterest resulting therefrom and accepts the implications on pricing, order handling and execution including as further set out herein.\n AMINA maintains a framework including policies, processes, training and education, controls and reporting, to identify and manage \nany potential conflicts of interest in connection with trading activities appropriately, in particular by taking measures to avoid their \nrealization or to mitigate the effects of realization or by disclosing them to the Client.\nII. Pricing\nArt. 7 AMINA Trading as Principal\n When trading as principal vis-\u00e0-vis the Client, AMINA quotes and applies \u201call-in\u201d prices for and to the relevant transactions in foreign \ncurrencies or Crypto Currencies. Such prices include a spread for the benefit of AMINA and determined in its discretion, taking into \naccount, in particular:\na) The relevant foreign currency/-ies or Crypto Currency/- ies;\nb) The size of the order;\nc) Market conditions, such as liquidity and volatility;\nd) Exceptional market events, in particular decisions of central banks and other monetary policy decisions, specific events  \naffecting Crypto Currencies such as forks in a blockchain or similar events;\ne) AMINA\u2019s inventory.\n The prices quoted and provided to the Client may further include a mark-up determined by AMINA in its discretion, taking into account, \nin particular:\na) Transaction processing costs and venue fees associated with execution;\nb) Credit and settlement risks associated with the transaction;\nc) Operational risks, including the operational stability of the market venues where transactions are executed;\nd) Financial resources, such as balance sheet, risk weighted assets, liquidity, funding and other items that may impact AMINA\u2019s \ncapital position.\n The mark-up applied by AMINA may not be uniform across transactions and clients. AMINA may in its discretion distinguish and adjust \nthe mark-up provided to the Client based on objective criteria, in particular the relevant trading activities and volumes and the level of \ndeposits of the Client with AMINA.\n AMINA determines pricing in respect of conversions, account transfers or trading in foreign currencies or Crypto Currencies pursuant \nto the principles set out above in good faith and with due consideration to the interests of the Client. However, as a counterparty to \nthe Client in a principal capacity, AMINA is not obliged to provide the best available price or \u201cbest execution\u201d to the Client and is not \nrequired to disclose the spread and mark-up applied by it in the specific transaction.AMINA Bank AG\nKolinplatz 15 \u2022 6300 Zug \u2022 Switzerland \ninfo@aminagroup.com \u2022 aminagroup.com3\nArt. 8 AMINA Trading as Riskless Principal\n When trading as riskless principal vis-\u00e0-vis the Client, AMINA passes on the price negotiated and agreed in the identical transaction  \nentered into by AMINA with other counterparties in the market (i.e. including any spread and fees applied by such counterparties), sub-\nject to a mark-up negotiated and agreed with the Client in advance. If AMINA enters into a combination of transactions to fill the order \nof the Client, it is entitled to apply an average price (including spreads) plus a mark-up. The mark-up offered to the Client is determined \nby AMINA in its discretion and may take into account substantially the same aspects as set forth in respect of the mark-up in Art. 7 Forex \nand Crypto Trading Terms (AMINA trading as principal).\n In negotiating and agreeing the transaction or transactions in the market required to fill the order of the Client, AMINA does not \nprovide a \u201cbest execution\u201d service, but will choose from one or several offers available to AMINA in the market, including from crypto \nor foreign exchange venues or directly from reputable liquidity providers, taking into account all circumstances and cost factors \nconsidered relevant by AMINA in its discretion.\nArt. 9 Responsibility of the Client\n The Client is required to examine the price quoted by AMINA in respect of each individual order and must determine, in its sole  \nresponsibility, whether such price is acceptable taking into account prevailing market conditions, its individual objectives and  \ncircumstances and all other relevant considerations. It is the sole responsibility of the Client to decide on proceeding with a transac-\ntion at the price and conditions quoted by AMINA.\nIII. Order Handling and Execution\nArt. 10 General Principles\n AMINA has no obligation to accept orders or instructions regarding foreign currencies or Crypto Currencies and may in its discretion \nprovide or decline to provide quotes, accept, reject, limit or cancel orders or instructions without giving any reason. Transactions with \nthe Client in foreign currencies or Crypto Currencies are entered into at the discretion of AMINA. In particular, Art. 3 GTC \u201cExecution of \ninstructions and orders; acceptance of funds and assets\u201d and Art. 9 Custody Regulations (Orders) apply.\n The Client may only rely on the valid acceptance of orders or instructions, or of any cancellations, modifications and corrections of \norders or instructions, upon confirmation by AMINA. Orders received via the same trading channel will generally be executed in the \nsequence in which they were acknowledged and accepted by AMINA.\n AMINA may further specify the terms of individual transactions in its quotes or trade confirmations provided to the Client.\n AMINA may choose the appropriate trading and execution venues or selection of venues in its discretion. In doing so, AMINA weighs \nthe relevant execution factors in the context of its general business and available market information, considering price, cost, speed, \nlikelihood of execution and settlement of execution, size and other relevant factors. The weight attributed to each factor is dynamic and \nmay depend upon several variables and characteristics, including the traded instrument, order type, market conditions, specific Client \ninstructions and other terms agreed with the Client.\nArt. 11 Pre-hedging\n AMINA may, as principal, conduct risk management and market making activities for its own account while executing a Client order or \nin anticipation of a Client order. This may involve AMINA undertaking pre-hedging activities in the market or positioning its portfolio to \nmeet anticipated demand.\n AMINA may further, as principal, pre-hedge Client orders if it considers, inter alia, that such hedging activity would be in the Client\u2019s \ninterest or that such hedging activity could avoid disrupting the market. In doing so, AMINA will take into consideration the prevailing \nmarket conditions as well as the size and nature of the anticipated transaction. Pre-hedging may result in profit, or loss, to AMINA.\n AMINA does not pre-hedge or pre-position when acting as riskless principal.\nIV. Risk Disclosure\nArt. 12 Trading Risk\n The Client is aware that trading in foreign currencies and Crypto Currencies is a highly speculative activity in potentially extremely \nvolatile and partially unregulated markets. As such, it involves substantial risks of loss including a total loss.\n In particular, trading orders are subject to a risk of slippage, i.e. they may be executed at a different price than expected at the time of \nentry of the order. This risk, and its potentially detrimental financial consequences for the Client, may intensify during periods of high \nvolatility, liquidity shortfalls or other exceptional market circumstances as well as in connection with market closures during weekends \nor on local holidays, all of which are outside the sphere of influence of AMINA. Such circumstances and events may also delay, hinder \nor outright prevent order execution or conversions between particular pairs of currencies or Crypto Currencies and may further add to \nthe cost of individual Client transactions.AMINA Bank AG\nKolinplatz 15 \u2022 6300 Zug \u2022 Switzerland \ninfo@aminagroup.com \u2022 aminagroup.com4\nArt. 13 Special Risks of Trading in Crypto Currencies\n Special risks of trading in Crypto Currencies are detailed in the document \u201cSpecial Risks of Digital Assets\u201d , as amended from time to \ntime, accessible under https:/ /www.aminagroup.com/legal-notices.\n The markets in Crypto Currencies are in principle not subject to closures during weekends or on local holidays. However, crypto  \nexchange venues may halt trading in particular Crypto Currencies due to external events such as forks in a relevant blockchain, which \nmay reduce or eliminate liquidity in such Crypto Currencies for extended periods of time.\nIV. Miscellaneous Provisions\nArt. 14 AMINA\u2019s Duty of Care\n AMINA shall conduct any conversions, account transfers or trading for the Client in foreign currencies or Crypto Currencies with Due \nCare.\nArt. 15 Fees and remuneration\n AMINA is entitled to debit from any account of the Client the relevant transaction settlement amounts as well as any fees, commissions \nand costs pursuant to these Forex and Crypto Trading Terms or agreed with the Client.\n AMINA reserves the right to adjust and amend the fee schedules at any time, including due to changes in market conditions or costs. \nChanges will be communicated to the Client by appropriate means, including as set forth in Art. 9 GTC \u201cUse of communications chan-\nnels; delivery of communications\u201d , and will take effect 30 days from the date of notification by AMINA unless otherwise specified by \nAMINA.\nArt. 16 Liability of AMINA\n AMINA\u2019s obligation towards the Client consists in due performance of its services and contractual duties, and, where applicable, the \ndue selection and instruction of third party service providers, in accordance with the standard of due care customary in Swiss banking \npractice or, where not established, the standard of care of a reasonable business person (\u201cDue Care\u201d), unless specified otherwise in \nthese Forex and Crypto Trading Terms and/or the GTC.\n Any liability of AMINA for any loss or damage suffered in the absence of any breach by AMINA of its applicable duty of care is excluded. \nIn the event of a loss or damage due to a breach by AMINA of its applicable duty of care, AMINA shall only be liable for direct losses \ncaused with intent or gross negligence. Any liability of AMINA for indirect or consequential losses (including loss of profit) is excluded.\n AMINA is not liable for any loss or damage due to events or the materialization of risks outside its sphere of influence nor for any loss or \ndamage caused or increased by the Client, in particular due to any failure on the part of the Client to take measures to avoid, mitigate \nor reduce any loss or damage.\nArt. 17 Severability\n If any provision of these Forex and Crypto Trading Terms is or becomes invalid or unenforceable, the remaining provisions shall continue \nto be binding.\nArt. 18 Amendments to the Forex and Crypto Trading Terms\n AMINA is entitled to amend and modify these Forex and Crypto Trading Terms at any time. The Client will be notified in advance of any \namendments by appropriate means, including as set forth in Art. 9 GTC (Use of communications channels; delivery of communications), \nand such amendments are deemed approved if the Client does not submit an objection within 30 days of the date of the amendment.\n The currently valid version of the Forex and Crypto Trading Terms, as amended from time to time, can be accessed under \n https:/ /www.aminagroup.com/legal-notices.\nArt. 19 Applicable Law and Place of Jurisdiction\n All legal relations between the Client and AMINA are governed by and shall be construed in accordance with Swiss law. The exclu-\nsive place of jurisdiction for all legal proceedings, subject to mandatory provisions of Swiss law, and the place of performance and \ndebt enforcement for Clients domiciled outside of Switzerland, is the City of Zug, Switzerland.

This may result in such data being transmitted across borders or pro-\ncessed outside of Switzerland by third parties without the possibility for AMINA to monitor or control such activities, including in the \ncase of data transmissions where the sender and recipient are located in Switzerland. While individual data packets are transmitted \nin encrypted form, the identities of the sender and recipient are generally unencrypted.

        "value": "Guidelines on the treatment  \nof assets without contact  \nand dormant assets held at  \nSwiss banks (Guidelines on  \nDormant Assets)\n2022\nSwiss Bankers Association (SBA)Preliminary\n1 The following Guidelines seek to ensure that organisational measures are in place to ensure \ncontact remains or can be restored between banks and customers. They also seek to set out  \nthe details of the legal process for publication and liquidating dormant assets in the interests  \nof those affected.\n2 In particular, they serve the following purposes:\n3 \u2022 Preventing contact with the customer from being broken off;\n4 \u2022 Protecting against the misuse of assets when contact with the customer has been broken off;\n5 \u2022 Managing assets in accordance with consistent principles when contact with the customer  \n has been broken off;\n6 \u2022 Restoring contact between banks and beneficiaries;\n7 \u2022 Making it easier for customers and other beneficiaries1 to search for assets;\n8 \u2022 Implementing in appropriate form the provisions of article 37m of the Banking Act and  \n articles 49\u201359 of the Banking Ordinance on the publication and liquidation of dormant  \n assets.\n1 Heirs, for example.\n \nSwiss Bankers Association (SBA) \u00b7 Guidelines on Dormant Assets \u00b7 2022\n2Terms \u2013 Basic principles on absence  \nof contact and on dormancy\n9 Introductory remarks: The term \"dormant assets\" is defined in article 45 of the Banking Ordinance; \ndormancy begins 10 years after the last documented contact with the customer. As described \nbelow, contact with the customer may be broken off at any time, resulting in absence of contact \nand placing the bank under the obligation to act in accordance with these Guidelines even before \nthe 10-year period has elapsed. Accordingly, a distinction must be drawn between\n10 \u2022 Dormancy (Banking Ordinance2) and\n11 \u2022 Absence of contact (Guidelines).\n12 Absence of contact:  This occurs in principle when the customer or their authorised agent \n(hereinafter referred to collectively as \"the customer\"3) fails to contact the bank and the bank is \nunable to contact the customer. If an authorised agent of the customer is also the customer's \nindependent portfolio manager, and if the business relationship between the authorised agent \nand the customer is without contact, the authorised agent may inform the bank. As a consequence, \nthe customer relationship will also be considered to be without contact for the bank.\n13 Absence of contact occurs in the case of a customer to whom post is regularly sent when:\n14 \u2022 The correspondence sent to the customer is returned;\n15 \u2022 There is no other contact whatever with the customer;\n16 \u2022 Measures taken by the bank to contact the customer (see IV. 2. and 3.) have failed.\n17 In the following cases, absence of contact occurs only after a period of 10 years (concurrently \nwith dormancy under article 45 of the Banking Ordinance), unless the bank has previously \nreceived knowledge that the customer has died and any heirs or authorised agents cannot be \ncontacted:\n18 a) Savings passbooks: When 10 years have passed without the customer having had interest \n entered and there has been no other contact with the customer.\n19 b) Safe-deposit boxes: When the customer has not visited their safe-deposit box for 10 years, \n and there has been no other contact with the customer.\n20 c) Poste restante at the bank or other special instructions of the customer: When there has \n been no contact with the customer for 10 years.\n2 English translation of legal quotes (Banking Act, Banking Ordinance) by SBA. \n3 Passing customers, who do not have to be documented as contracting partners under the Agreement on the Swiss banks' code of \nconduct with regard to the exercise of due diligence (CDB), are not deemed to be customers within the meaning of these Guidelines.\n \nSwiss Bankers Association (SBA) \u00b7 Guidelines on Dormant Assets \u00b7 2022\n321 Digital banking relationships  (e-banking, mobile banking): Absence of contact occurs when \nthere has been no contact with the customer for 3 years, unless the bank has previously \nreceived knowledge that the customer has died and any heirs or authorised agents cannot be \ncontacted.\n22 Contact:  Means any news, instruction, message or statement received from the customer or \ntheir heir which triggers a movement on the account or custody account, or an entry in the files. \nThe same applies in the case of e-banking or mobile banking, plus any login using the customer's \nmeans of identification, where such login can be ascertained. There is no longer deemed to  \nbe any contact in cases where in the event of the customer's death any heir or authorised agent \ndoes not assist in the provision of proof of legal succession within a reasonable period.\n23 Customer relationship: Absence of contact relates to the customer of a bank in Switzerland  \nand not to a particular contractual relationship with them. Where a customer has several accounts, \npassbooks, custody accounts or safe-deposit boxes, any contact concerning a single one of them \nprecludes all of them from being without contact.\n23a Assets:  The following may become assets without contact or dormant assets:\n23b  \u2022 accounts, passbooks (including bearer savings books), custody accounts and safe-deposit boxes;\n23c \u2022 other assets that can no longer be attributed to a customer relationship, provided the bank  \n knows or has a reason to suspect that they belong to a customer or a former customer  \n (examples being remaining balances on debit and credit cards, balances on collective accounts  \n or collective custody accounts opened before the rule set out in margin no. 39, former custody  \n account holdings and income [e.g. from corporate actions], over-the-counter or night safe  \n payments that cannot be attributed to a customer, and ATM payments that were not accepted  \n and cannot be attributed to a customer). Simple settlement differences (e.g. due to rounding)  \n are not deemed to be assets within the meaning of these Guidelines.\n24 Dormancy  (article 45 of the Banking Ordinance): \n\"1 Assets are considered dormant if the bank or person under article 1b of the Banking Act has \nbeen unable to make contact for 10 years following the last contact with the bank customer or \ntheir heirs (beneficiaries) or one of their authorised agents.\n 2 The last contact is considered to be the last contact shown in the records of the bank or \nperson under article 1b of the Banking Act4.\n 3 Assets which are transferred to another bank or person under article 1b of the Banking Act \nowing to the liquidation of the transferring bank or person under article 1b of the Banking  \nAct are considered dormant before 10 years have expired if the transferring bank provides \nevidence that it has taken all necessary steps to restore contact with the beneficiary.\"\n25 The occurrence of dormancy does not abrogate absence of contact under these Guidelines. \nHowever, restoration of contact with the customer abrogates both absence of contact and \ndormancy.\n4 See also margin no. 13 et seq.\n \nSwiss Bankers Association (SBA) \u00b7 Guidelines on Dormant Assets \u00b7 2022\n4I. Preventive measures against loss of contact \n with the customer\n26 Banks must use preventive measures to take precautions and create instruments to avoid \ncontact with customers being broken off.\n1. Product design\n27 Banks should design their products so as to ensure contact between customer and bank and  \nas far as possible minimise the risk of losing contact.\n2. Customer information\n28 Banks should inform customers verbally or in writing of the problems and consequences  \nof absence of contact when opening a business relationship and on further suitable occasions, \nand draw their attention to their own responsibility to avoid loss of contact. \n29 During personal conversations with the customer where the subject of absence of contact  \nis raised, the implications of their death, which may harbour particular risks in this respect, \nshould also be discussed.\n30 Banks may provide customers with a leaflet for general information. The Swiss Bankers \nAssociation may make such a leaflet available to banks.\nII.  Supervising and managing assets without contact\n1. Organisational measures\n31 Banks must issue internal directives containing the following measures for central processing:\n32 \u2022 A suitable control system must ensure that all assets without contact are identified promptly \n and completely.\n33 \u2022 The assets in question must be specially highlighted and recorded centrally by the bank  \n in order to make it easier for beneficiaries to search for them.\n34 \u2022 Suitable security measures must be put in place to protect the assets in question from \n unauthorised access.\n35 \u2022 Banks must designate internal units or persons responsible for handling assets without contact.\n \nSwiss Bankers Association (SBA) \u00b7 Guidelines on Dormant Assets \u00b7 2022\n536 \u2022 Special archiving principles (see margin no. 51\u201352 below) must be observed for the assets \n in question.\n37 \u2022 These Guidelines apply equally to numbered accounts, numbered custody accounts \n and safe-deposit boxes.\n38 \u2022 Banks must keep a record of the costs to be charged to customers for dealing with assets \n without contact.\n39 \u2022 Banks may pool existing accounts in a collective account at their own discretion. If they do so, \n the information required for any publication or liquidation under article 49 (3) of the Banking \n Ordinance (margin nos. 82\u201385) must be archived as far as available, and margin nos. 51 and 52  \n continue to apply.\n2. Protection of beneficiaries' rights in the event of absence of contact and waiver of right \nto terminate\n40 The rights of customers and their heirs in respect of the bank are not affected by absence  \nof contact.\n41 Waiver of right to terminate: The bank waives the right to terminate contractual relationships with \ncustomers merely on the grounds of absence of contact and to thereby trigger a limitation period.\n42 Exception:  Banks have the right to terminate a contractual relationship or set off their claims \nagainst the customer or their heirs, if they are not met when due or are no longer covered. \nSpecial regulations, in particular regulations issued by governments and other authorities requiring \ntermination or making it seem appropriate, may also apply.\n3. Managing assets so as to protect interests in the event of absence of contact\n43 The bank must protect the reasonable interests of customers or their heirs who are the beneficiaries \nof assets in the event of absence of contact. Banks must issue internal directives to ensure such \nassets are managed in a consistent manner. The following principles must be observed:\n44 \u2022 Savings accounts  must be continued unchanged and interest accrued at the bank's current rates.\n45 \u2022 Current accounts and similar balances  must be invested to protect the customer's interests, \n i.e. diligently and, as far as the customer's interests allow, profitably (e.g. in savings accounts, \n medium-term notes or a fund with a conservative risk profile).\n46 \u2022 Custody accounts  should be continued as usual; money from maturing securities and \n accumulated interest should be invested in similar or other suitable securities or savings \n products, taking into account the investment situation at the time of reinvestment.  \n The bank may carry out reinvestments on the basis of an existing customer profile. Smaller \n \nSwiss Bankers Association (SBA) \u00b7 Guidelines on Dormant Assets \u00b7 2022\n6 custody accounts may be transferred to, for example, a fund or similar to generate  \n an appropriate return at the discretion of the bank.\n47 \u2022 Portfolio management mandates must be continued unchanged. If the instructions or  \n investment strategy laid down by the customer are manifestly detrimental to their interests, \n the bank may make appropriate amendments to the investment strategy.\n48 \u2022 Safe-deposit boxes  may be opened, especially when the rent is no longer covered, in accordance  \n with internal directives. Even where the rent is covered, safe-deposit boxes may be opened \n in the event of dormancy or absence of contact in order to complete the search measures or with  \n a view to liquidation. The contents of safe-deposit boxes that have been opened may be stored  \n centrally. The bank must keep a record of the opening of a safe-deposit box. It may destroy  \n contents with no value after documenting them. Contents with no value include in particular \n bank documents with no relevance to the customer relationship or its restoration (e.g. uncom-  \n pleted forms or copies of bank documents that no longer have any information value or are \n also available electronically), blank paper, empty envelopes, boxes and other containers, paper  \n clips, and writing instruments.\n49 If the contents of a safe-deposit box are standard bank assets and administrative action or \ninvestment seems to be required in the customer's interests, the bank must take the necessary \nsteps. For all other assets, the bank's actions are restricted to safekeeping.\n4. Costs and fees\n50 The bank's usual fees and costs continue to apply in cases of absence of contact or dormancy. \nBanks may also charge the customer for costs incurred for making inquiries and for special \nhandling and treatment of assets without contact. Expenditure which leads to disproportional \ncharges for the customer must be avoided (see also margin no. 54).\n50a  Recurring fees must not be charged after the assets are published (margin nos. 74\u201388). In addition, \nfees may no longer be charged on assets that fall below the threshold for publication if they \nhave been dormant for 50 years or there has been no customer contact for 60 years (margin \nnos. 75, 76 and 79).\nIII. Archiving\n1. Archiving in the event of absence of contact\n51 The bank must archive contractual/basic documents and account/custody account statements held \nwhen absence of contact occurs beyond the statutory retention period (article 958f CO) until \nliquidation (article 37m of the Banking Act, article 57 of the Banking Ordinance) or restoration of \ncontact with the customer. The extended archiving requirement does not apply to relationships \nclosed by the bank for lack of credit balance.\n \nSwiss Bankers Association (SBA) \u00b7 Guidelines on Dormant Assets \u00b7 2022\n72. Nature of archiving\n52 Documents and records may be archived in any standard form, e.g. original files, electronic data \nmedia or similar.\nIV.\t Searching\t for\tbeneficiaries\t \u2013\trestoring\t customer\t \t\t\n contact\n1. Principles for searching for beneficiaries\na) Bank-client confidentiality\n53 Bank-client confidentiality must be observed when searching for the beneficiary of assets \nwithout contact. This is without prejudice to any action taken by the bank under articles \n37l\u201337m of the Banking Act and articles 46\u201359 of the Banking Ordinance (margin nos. 72\u201392).\nb) Proportionality of search measures\n54 Searches by banks for individual beneficiaries must be proportionate. The costs and effort \nshould reflect the amount of assets concerned and remain proportionate overall.\n2. Searches by banks\n55 Once a bank ascertains that contact has been lost with a customer, attempts must be made to \nrestore contact with the customer by means of internal inquiries such as address books, electronic \ntelephone books, the internet etc., or with the assistance of service providers.\n56 If these measures are unsuccessful, it is for the banks to decide whether and when they appoint  \nan agent to search for the customer/heir. Again, such action by the bank must be proportionate.\n3. Searches through the Central Claims Office\n57 Central Claims Office: For the search of beneficiaries for assets without contact, the Board  \nof Directors of the Swiss Bankers Association appoints the Swiss Banking Ombudsman as  \nthe Central Claims Office. A service provider appointed by the Swiss Bankers Association \nadministers the database of assets without contact (hereinafter referred to as \"the database\").\na) Banks' obligation to report\n58 Banks in Switzerland are obliged to enter the details of all customers without contact where  \nthe assets amount to more than CHF 500, and the details of all safe-deposit boxes, into  \n \nSwiss Bankers Association (SBA) \u00b7 Guidelines on Dormant Assets \u00b7 2022\n8the database if their investigations are unsuccessful (margin no. 55). Only the Swiss Banking \nOmbudsman, as the Central Claims Office, has access to the database.\n59 The report must contain the surname, first name, date of birth, nationality and address of the \ncustomer and any authorised agent, where available. This also applies to numbered or pseudonym \naccounts and custody accounts.\n60 Once contact with a customer has been restored, the information in the database must be \ndeleted by the relevant bank. The same applies when an asset without contact has fallen in value \nto less than CHF 500 or been exhausted or absorbed, for instance, as a result of being used to \npay costs or fees charged (see margin no. 50) or for offsetting purposes.\nb) Conditions for initiating an enquiry by the Central Claims Office\n61 Anyone who credibly claims to be a customer or heir of a deceased or missing customer of  \na bank or a representative of such but does not know the name of the bank can ask the Central \nClaims Office to make inquiries into dormant assets. The Central Claims Office requires:\n62 \u2022 A credible claim that there is a customer relationship with a bank in Switzerland;\n63 \u2022 The name of the person for whom the account, passbook, custody account or safe-deposit \n box was held;\n64 \u2022 Documentary evidence of the entitlement of the claimant to any account, passbook,  \n custody account or safe-deposit box that may still exist, specifically their identity and \n inheritance status.\nc) Preliminary examination by the Central Claims Office\n65 The Central Claims Office makes a preliminary examination of the documents submitted.  \nIf the request is deemed to be justified, it carries out a search of the database.\nd) Forwarding the request to the relevant bank\n66 If the information in a claim matches a name in the database sufficiently closely, the Central \nClaims Office forwards the claim to the relevant bank for examination.\ne) Decision by the bank\n67 The bank must examine the applications received with appropriate diligence and decide on the \nclaimant's entitlement based on the information available. If any further information is required, \nthe bank may request this through the Central Claims Office.\n68 If the decision is favourable, the bank must report the findings of its inquiry either to the Central \nClaims Office or directly to the claimant; if the latter, the Central Claims Office must be informed \nat the same time.\n \nSwiss Bankers Association (SBA) \u00b7 Guidelines on Dormant Assets \u00b7 2022\n969 If the decision is negative, the bank must report its findings to the Central Claims Office together \nwith a short substantiation. If there is any doubt, the Central Claims Office is entitled to examine \nthe bank's records and if necessary issue a recommendation, together with instructions to \ncontact the claimant in order that the claimant can enforce their claim against the bank directly.\nf) Confidentiality\n70 The Central Claims Office and the service provider responsible for the database are subject  \nto bank-client confidentiality under article 47 of the Banking Act.\ng) Fees\n71 In principle, the Central Claims Office charges fees for handling such claims that are payable  \nby the claimant. It may waive these as it deems appropriate in special circumstances, e.g. cases \nof financial hardship. The fees are set by the supervisory body of the Central Claims Office  \nin consultation with the Swiss Bankers Association. The service provider responsible for the \ndatabase may also charge banks a registration fee.\nV. Transfer to another bank and liquidation  \nin the event of dormancy\n72 The measures to be taken in the event of dormancy are based on article 37l\u201337m of the Banking \nAct and articles 45\u201359 of the Banking Ordinance. The Banking Act and Banking Ordinance take \nprecedence over these Guidelines, whose purpose is to implement their application in practice.\n1. Transfer to another bank\n73 In the event of the transfer of dormant assets to another bank and within the framework  \nof the provisions of article 37l of the Banking Act and articles 46\u201348 of the Banking Ordinance, \nbanks are free to decide about their proceedings.\n2. Publication and liquidation\na) Publication\n74 Under article 50 (2) of the Banking Ordinance, the banks provide an electronic platform for  \nthe publication of dormant assets. A service provider appointed by the Swiss Bankers Association \nruns this platform, which meets state-of- the-art security requirements. Claimants must enter \ntheir claims to published assets electronically on the platform, which forwards them automatically \nto the relevant bank.\n \nSwiss Bankers Association (SBA) \u00b7 Guidelines on Dormant Assets \u00b7 2022\n1074a The Board of Directors of the Swiss Bankers Association has appointed the Swiss Banking \nOmbudsman as contact point for the platform (Central Claims Office).\n74b The Central Claims Office provides general information on the platform and handles queries \nconcerning claims reported via the platform (e.g. from claimants who have not yet had a response \nand wish to know the status of their claim). By way of exception, the Central Claims Office  \nmay also accept written claims to published assets. It forwards these to the relevant bank without \nreviewing them.\n75 Banks must publish assets of over CHF 500 that have been dormant for 50 years or for which \nthere has been no customer contact for 60 years (article 49 of the Banking Ordinance, see \nmargin nos. 82\u201385 below). To this end, they enter information on these assets in the database  \nat least once a year (see margin no. 88). The service provider responsible for the database takes \nthe information from the bank unchanged and publishes it as instructed by the bank, normally \nonce a year on a date recommended by the Swiss Bankers Association.\n76 When calculating whether the threshold of CHF 500 making publication obligatory has been \nreached, the calculation basis is the total value of dormant assets the bank holds for the same \nbeneficiary (article 59 (2) of the Banking Ordinance). Valuation of the assets is based on the \nfollowing principles:\n77 \u2022 Accounts and passbooks:  The balance plus the contractual rate of interest up to the end  \n of the preceding year, less fees and costs (see margin no. 50).\n78 \u2022 Securities and precious metals: The market price or market value at the end of the preceding  \n year, less fees and costs (see margin no. 50). Where a market price or value is not available, \n the nominal value applies.\n79 \u2022 In the case of assets whose value is immediately recognisable as not exceeding CHF 500, \n no publication is required. This applies, for instance, to the contents of safe-deposit boxes. \n However, the bank is authorised to publish such assets should it choose to do so. In this case, \n the assets are published with the remark \"Safe-deposit box \u2013 value unknown\". In the case  \n of assets whose value could possibly exceed CHF 500, publication is obligatory, along with \n the remark \"Safe-deposit box \u2013 value unknown\".\n80 \"If publication of an advertisement with the aim of locating the beneficiaries in a particular case \nis deemed suitable in another communication medium, the bank or the person under article 1b \nof the Banking Act must also publish the request for information in this communication medium\" \n(article 50 (3) of the Banking Ordinance).\n81 If the information available allows the bank to subsequently restore contact with the customer \n(see margin no. 53\u201373), the assets concerned are no longer dormant, and the entry in the database \nmust be deleted.\n \nSwiss Bankers Association (SBA) \u00b7 Guidelines on Dormant Assets \u00b7 2022\n1182 \"Where available\", the following information must be published (article 49 (3) of the Banking \nOrdinance), whereby the Swiss Bankers Association may publish technical explanations of specific \nissues, in particular in the event of incomplete data, in a circular:\n83 \u2022 \"The address to which a claim to the published asset is to be sent\" (article 49 (3)(a)).\n84 \u2022 \"Name, date of birth and nationality or company name of the beneficiary and the last  \n known domicile or registered office \" (article 49 (3) (b)). This also applies in particular  \n to numbered and pseudonym accounts or passbooks. In the case of safe-deposit boxes,  \n the corresponding information on the person who rented it is to be published. The date  \n of birth is only relevant for natural persons.\n85 \u2022 \"The account or passbook number, where the otherwise available information appears  \n insufficient for the identity check\"  (article 49 (3) (c)).\n86 A decision may be taken not to publish, where such a decision is in the \"clear interests of the \nbeneficiary\" (point 3 under article 49 (3)) e.g. in the case of prominent and politically exposed \npersons.\n87 Publication must make clear that, where claims are manifestly unfounded (article 53 (3) of the \nBanking Ordinance), the bank may charge the costs incurred in examining the claim (article 49 (4) (a)), \nand also that \"claims become null and void upon liquidation of the assets\" (para 4 (b)).\n88 \"Several dormant asset positions may be published together\" (article 50 (5) of the Banking \nOrdinance). This means that it is not necessary to publish every position separately; several \npositions may be listed together and published, for instance, at regular intervals, but at least \nonce a year.\n89 Reported claims (margin no. 74, third sentence) are forwarded to the relevant bank.\n90 \"On receiving forwarded claims to dormant assets, the bank or person under article 1b of the \nBanking Act must examine these on a case-by-case basis in accordance with the relevant legal \nand contractual provisions\" (article 53 (1) sentence 1 of the Banking Ordinance). It does so \naccording to the same standard as for assets without contact and dormant assets that have not \nyet been published and for which a claim has been reported to the Central Claims Office by  \na claimant (margin no. 67). The only difference is that the Swiss Banking Ombudsman does not \ncarry out a preliminary examination of claims pertaining to published assets before forwarding \nthem. The bank contacts the claimant \u2013 or at least sends the claimant a confirmation of receipt \u2013 \nwithin one month. If it requires additional information, it should usually request this directly \nfrom the claimant. If there are particular reasons for doing so, the bank may refrain from contacting \nthe claimant directly or sending a confirmation of receipt and request the additional information \nthrough the Central Claims Office. \n90a \"If, on examining the claim, the bank finds that it is justified, the assets in question are no longer \nconsidered dormant\" (article 53 (2) of the Banking Ordinance). As soon as it has contacted the \n \nSwiss Bankers Association (SBA) \u00b7 Guidelines on Dormant Assets \u00b7 2022\n12beneficiary or beneficiaries and notified them that their claim has been recognised and that they \nhave power of disposal over the assets, it deletes the publication (margin no. 58).\n91 The bank notifies the claimant if it finds that a claim is not justified. \"The bank or person under \narticle 1b of the Banking Act must document the results of its investigations in such a way as to \nensure that the investigations are transparent\" (article 53 (4) of the Banking Ordinance).\nb) Liquidation\n92 The bank must liquidate the assets within 2 years of the expiry of the reporting deadline if no \nclaim was reported during that time, or within two years of \"finding that the claims made are  \nnot justified\" and keep a record both of the decision to liquidate the assets and of the liquidation \nof the assets (articles 54\u201357 of the Banking Ordinance). The bank must make arrangements  \nfor such assets to be liquidated in a way that, in the bank's due judgement, will allow for the best \npossible liquidation proceeds. Means of realising assets include in particular public auction, internet \nauction and private sale. Assets may not be sold privately to employees of the bank or their family \nmembers. The bank may arrange for assets to be transferred to specialised persons or companies \nfor realisation. Dormant assets that could not be realised in the realisation process arranged  \nby the bank, or those that, in the bank's judgement, have no liquidation value, must be offered by \nthe bank to the government. If the government does not accept the assets, the bank may dispose \nof them in a proper, environmentally compatible way or give them to a recognised charitable \norganisation (article 54 (2) of the Banking Ordinance). Net proceeds resulting from liquidations \nmust be transferred to the Federal Finance Administration at least once a year; upon this transfer, \nthe liquidations concerned are complete and the claims of the beneficiaries become null and void \n(article 37m (2\u20133) of the Banking Act and article 57 of the Banking Ordinance).\n92a The following specific rules apply to liquidation:\n92b \u2022 Account balances must be liquidated.\n92c \u2022 Custody accounts must be liquidated, with securities being sold at market prices and the \n proceeds credited to the related account. This does not apply to securities that currently \n have little or no value (\"penny stocks\"), which are not subject to compulsory liquidation and \n delivery; they may be booked out by the bank.\n92d \u2022 No interest: Any assets delivered after they have been published are to be delivered \n interest-free with effect from the publication date.\n92e \u2022 No fees: Margin no. 50a applies. The bank is entitled to charge any extraordinary costs  \n and expenses.\n92f \u2022 Contents of safe-deposit boxes must be liquidated in the manner that promises the highest \n proceeds. If no better option can be found, the bank offers the items to a liquidator for public  \n auction.\n \nSwiss Bankers Association (SBA) \u00b7 Guidelines on Dormant Assets \u00b7 2022\n1392g \u2022 Assets that cannot be realised or have no liquidation value must be offered to the federal \n government (article 54 (2) of the Banking Ordinance), provided they have not been destroyed  \n before the obligation to liquidate under margin no. 48 takes effect, in the form of a list \n containing meaningful descriptions of the items offered, accompanied by photographs and  \n sent to the Head of Legal Services at the Federal Department of Finance, General Legal Services  \n Section. This obligation to offer does not apply to documents with no value such as account \n and custody account statements, photographs, newspaper clippings etc.\n92h \u2022 Documents that may have a non-financial value for the Confederation on historical or other \n grounds must be offered to the federal government.\n92i \u2022 Liquidation costs incurred by the bank may be deducted from the liquidation proceeds before  \n they are transferred to the Federal Finance Administration (article 57 (1) of the Banking \n Ordinance), applicable collectively to all liquidation proceeds delivered by the bank on a given  \n date. The liquidation costs may be quoted as a lump sum in the liquidation record as long  \n as this is made clear.\nVI. Entry into force\n93 These Guidelines enter into force on 1 July 2022 and replace those of 1 January 2015.\n \nSwiss Bankers Association (SBA) \u00b7 Guidelines on Dormant Assets \u00b7 2022\n14Swiss Bankers Association\nAeschenplatz 7\nP.O.

Also affected are natural persons with a corresponding tax residence who as con-\ntrolling person (namely shareholders, beneficial owners, settlors, beneficiaries, etc.) exercise control over an entity considered to be a passive \nNon-Financial Entity (NFE).\nNo exchange takes place within Switzerland. Thus, AMINA will not forward any data of its Swiss resident account holders to the FTA. In the case \nof accounts held by legal entities or trusts, reporting may also take place under certain conditions if a controlling person is resident in a partner \nstate.\nHow and with whom is the data exchanged?\nAMINA reports the relevant data to the FTA. The FTA then forwards this information to the respective tax authorities of the reportable persons. \nThe FTA exchanges the data with states that have signed an agreement with Switzerland (AEOI partner states).\nA list of the AEOI partner states of Switzerland can be found at this link: https:/ /www.sif.admin.ch/sif/en/home/multilateral/steuer_information-\nsaust/automatischer-informationsaustausch/automatischer-informationsaustausch1.html.\nWhat is the permissible use of this information?\nThe partner states use the information received for tax purposes only. In principle, it is not allowed for the AEOI partner state to forward the infor -\nmation to another country. Also, the information is to be handled confidentially.\nWhat information will be reported under the AEOI?\nAccording to the AEOI Act, AMINA Bank AG is obliged to report identification and account information about reportable persons to the FTA each \nyear.\nThe following information is sent:\n\u2022 Name\n\u2022 Address\n\u2022 Tax resident state(s)\n\u2022 Tax identification number(s) (TIN)\n\u2022 Date of birth (only for natural persons)\n\u2022 Type of account holder (only for entities)\n\u2022 Type of controlling person (only for entities)\n\u2022 Account number(s) and name of the financial institution\n\u2022 Total gross amount of interest, dividends and other income generated by the assets\n\u2022 Total gross proceeds from the sale or redemption of assets\n\u2022 Total account balance of the relevant year\nIf an account has been closed, the values accrued up to the closing date and the fact of the closure will be reported.AMINA Bank AG\nKolinplatz 15 \u2022 6300 Zug \u2022 Switzerland \ninfo@aminagroup.com \u2022 aminagroup.com2\nWhat are the rights of the reportable persons?\nIn accordance with the AEOI Act and the Federal Act on Data Protection (FADP), persons obliged to provide information have the following rights:\na) With regard to AMINA:\n Persons obliged to provide information are entitled to the full extent of legal protection offered by the FADP with regard to AMINA. In particu-\nlar, you have the right to request what information has been collected about you and will be reported to the FTA.\n AMINA must provide you with a copy of its report to the FTA on request. Fiscally-relevant information that has been reported to the FTA may \ndiffer from the data that has been collected. Moreover, you are also entitled to request that AMINA corrects inaccurate data in its system.\nb) With regard to the FTA:\n The only right you can assert with regard to the FTA is the right to information, under which they may request the rectification of incorrect data \ndue to transmission errors. You are entitled to request that incorrect data resulting from errors in the exchange process be corrected. If the \ntransmission of information results in disadvantages for you that you cannot reasonably be expected to accept due to insufficient constitu-\ntional guarantees, you shall be granted the rights set out in article 25a of the Administrative Procedure Act.\n You are not entitled to access FTA records. This means that you do not have the right to block the disclosure of personal details to the FTA. In \naddition, you cannot verify the legality of the disclosure of information abroad or demand the prevention of unlawful disclosure or the destruc-\ntion of data which has been processed without sufficient legal grounds\nImportant Note\nIt should be noted that the information to be collected and reported under the AEOI Act does not constitute a tax base and may therefore differ \nfrom the respective tax-relevant information. In this context AMINA advises that the client is responsible for compliance with all applicable laws \nwith respect to the assets held or accounted for by AMINA for the client. AMINA further recommends that clients who are affected by the AEOI \nclarify any tax issues with a specialist. In addition, the AEOI reporting does not replace the tax declaration and reporting obligations of AMINA\u2019s \nclients.",

Anyone who offers or intends to offer \nsecurities for trading is thus an issuer.\nWho is a financial service provider?\nA financial service provider is anyone who provides financial services on a professional basis (i.e. as a \npermanent, independent and commercial activity) in Switzerland or for clients in Switzerland. Banks and \nother financial institutions also qualify as financial service providers.\nWhat are typical financial services?\nVarious forms of financial services are offered for investment solutions: portfolio management, invest -\nment advice and execution-only (with no advice). With portfolio management, investment decisions are \ndelegated to the financial service provider. With investment advice and execution-only services, the client \nretains full responsibility for investment decisions. The financial service provider\u2019s duties thus differ,  \nparticularly as regards informing the client.\nWhat is the difference between direct and indirect investments?\nDirect investments involve investing in actual assets \u2013 such as shares, bonds, real estate, precious metals \nor commodities \u2013 directly. Indirect investments involve investing in assets indirectly via an investment \nvehicle, for example a fund or structured product.\nDirect and indirect investments can be used for different purposes. Funds for instance, focus on risk \ndiversification, whereas structured products with participation or leverage (see section 2.7 and  \nsection\u00a03.4.3) strive to maximise returns. Other investments offer the opportunity to invest in an other -\nwise inaccessible asset class, commodity certificates being a good example.Physical and book-entry securities\nPhysical securities are those that exist in physical form, namely as a piece of paper.\nThese days, most financial instruments no longer exist in physical form. They are known as book-entry \nsecurities \u2013 also referred to as uncertificated securities in the Federal Act on Intermediated Securities of \n3 October 2008. Bookentry securities, including shares (see section 2.1), bonds (see section 2.2) and  \ncollective investment schemes (see section 2.4 ), are so called because they are simply booked to a  \ncustody account.Swiss Bankers Association \u00b7 Risks Involved in T rading Financial Instruments71  General information\nWhether an investment is direct or indirect has no bearing on its risks or returns. When deciding to invest \nindirectly, for example in alternative investments (see Glossary ), it is important to consider not only the \nrisk associated with the asset class, but also the risks attached to the financial instruments contained in the \ninvestment vehicle. This is especially true for structured products. Direct alternative investments generally \nrequire a relatively high minimum investment and are often not available to all investors.\nWhat are limited and unlimited risks?\nFinancial instruments with limited risk entail the risk of making no profit and possibly losing all of the \ninvested capital in a worst-case scenario. With unlimited-risk instruments, the investors may even have to \npay out more money on top of what they originally invested, perhaps several times as much.\n1.2 Typical financial services\nAccording to FinSA, typical financial services for investment solutions include portfolio management, \ninvestment advice and execution-only transactions with no advice.\nInvestment advice\nInvestment advice consists of personal recommendations that relate to the trading of financial instru-\nments. It can be either portfolio-based (geared to the client\u2019s portfolio and defined investment strategy) \nor transaction-based (focused on individual financial instruments).\nOnly banks or other financial institutions with the requisite licence or persons entered in the Register of \nAdvisers may provide investment advice on a professional basis.\nInvestment advice relating to certain categories of financial instruments, e.g. collective investment \nschemes and structured products, obliges financial service providers to supply private clients with a key \ninformation document explaining how the instrument works as well as the risks and costs it involves.\nPortfolio management\nWith portfolio management, the client entrusts assets to the financial service provider and instructs the \nlatter to invest them on their behalf in accordance with a contractual agreement that sets out the client\u2019s \ninvestment goals. Investment decisions are made exclusively by the financial service provider. Portfolio \nmanagement agreements can differ from one provider to another, but they always involve the delegation \nof the management of assets.\nSince the financial service provider is responsible for investment decisions, it is not obliged to supply key \ninformation documents for the financial instruments used.\nExecution-only\nWith execution-only services, clients make their own investments without receiving any advice or \nrecommendations from the financial service provider. The client thus bears full responsibility for assess-\ning investment instruments and the risks they entail.Swiss Bankers Association \u00b7 Risks Involved in T rading Financial Instruments8However, for certain categories of financial instruments, e.g. collective investment schemes and struc -\ntured products, the financial service provider must supply the client with a key information document, if \none is available, before executing execution- only transactions.\nLoans for trading in financial instruments\nConventional lending, including mortgages, is subject to civil-law provisions under the Swiss Civil Code \n(SCC) and the Code of Obligations (CO). However, when a client takes out a loan in order to invest in \nfinancial instruments, for instance in the form of a Lombard loan, this financial service is subject to FinSA. \nDue to the specific risks associated with this type of lending, the FinSA provisions on investor protection \napply in full (see section 1.3 \u201cRisks involved in credit-financed investments\u201d).1  General informationSwiss Bankers Association \u00b7 Risks Involved in T rading Financial Instruments91  General information\n1.3 General risks in trading financial instruments\nThis section explains the general risks involved in trading financial instruments.\nCountry risk\nThe value of a financial instrument and thus the possibility of accessing it depend on various political, \nlegal and economic factors relating to the country in which it is issued, held in custody or traded.\nCountry risks concern the political and economic stability of a given country. Examples of political risks \ninclude the potential confiscation of assets and state intervention in certain industries. Economic risks \ntypically include fluctuations in interest and inflation rates. Other country risks concern the quality of \ninfrastructure (particularly as regards clearing houses and exchanges) and the legislative framework: \nmarket transparency, supervisory authorities, investor protection, insolvency regimes and taxation.\nAll of these can change over time, sometimes in unpredictable ways. In the past, for example, some states \nhave imposed restrictions on trading in financial instruments via economic sanctions or controls on the \nexporting and free movement of capital. These can make it difficult or even impossible to retain control \nof or sell the financial instruments affected, even if they are held with a Swiss bank.\nCountries with special risks: emerging markets\nThere is no standard definition of the term \u201cemerging market\u201d (alternatively \u201cdeveloping country\u201d). \nCommon criteria for defining emerging markets are income per capita, the level of development of the \nfinancial sector and the proportion of the total economy made up by the service sector. Emerging \nmarkets can be at very different stages of economic development, but one thing most of them have in \ncommon is that their political, legal and economic systems are either comparatively new (e.g. democracy) \nor not very firmly established. As a result, emerging markets\u2019 financial systems and institutions tend to \nenjoy less stability and legal certainty than their counterparts in developed countries.\nInvestments in emerging markets entail risks that are less pronounced or entirely absent in developed \ncountries, including settlement (see Settlement risk) and liquidity risks (see Liquidity risk). Higher risks \nassociated with investments in financial instruments relating to emerging markets also apply when the \nissuer (see section 1. 1) or offeror only has its head office or the focus of its activity in such a market.\nIssuer risk\nMost investments involve a risk that the issuer (see Glossary ) will become insolvent. This is called the \nissuer risk. A financial instrument\u2019s value depends not only on product-specific aspects \u2013 e.g. business \nresults for equities or the performance of the underlying financial instrument for structured products \u2013  \nbut also on the issuer\u2019s creditworthiness. This can change at any time during the term of an investment.  Swiss Bankers Association \u00b7 Risks Involved in T rading Financial Instruments101  General information\nIt is therefore important to know who issued the instrument in question and who is responsible for \nmeeting the obligations. This is essential for correctly assessing the issuer\u2019s creditworthiness and thus the \nissuer risk. With debt instruments (see Glossary ) such as bonds, this risk is known as the credit risk \nbecause the borrower normally acts as the issuer.\nSettlement risk\nA settlement risk arises when a financial instrument must be bought at a specific price before delivery. In \nthis case, the investor risks paying the purchase price without receiving the instrument on time or even at \nall. Conversely, an investor who sells a financial instrument and must deliver it without receiving the \npurchase price also incurs a settlement risk. Settlement risks are especially high in emerging markets and \nfor some offshore funds, private equity investments and derivatives (see Glossary ).\nCurrency risk\nIf a financial instrument is denominated in a currency other than the investor\u2019s reference currency (see \nGlossary ), the risk of exchange rate fluctuations must be taken into account. Some financial service \nproviders recommend using hedging instruments to minimise this risk or offer currency-hedged products. \nCurrency risk can thus be mitigated, but \u2013 depending on the asset class and hedging technique in \nquestion \u2013 it cannot always be completely eliminated.\nLiquidity risk\nLiquidity risk is the risk that an investor will not always be able to sell an investment at an appropriate \nprice. When specific financial instruments or derivatives are difficult or impossible to sell or can only be \nsold at a greatly reduced price, this is termed an illiquid market. The risk of illiquidity occurs in particular \nwith unlisted and small-capitalisation companies, investments in emerging markets (see Glossary ), \ninvestments with sales restrictions, some structured products and alternative investments (see Glossary ). \nIn addition, liquidity risks cannot be ruled out with bonds if they are merely held after issue (see Glossary ) \nand hardly traded at all.\nLegal risk\nT o evaluate the legal risk attached to an investment, its legal framework must be taken into account. This \nincludes legal provisions on investor protection, for example investment guidelines and obligations \nregarding transparency, information and disclosure as well as bans on insider trading and duties of \nmanagement. Attention must also be paid to the mechanisms and institutions that enforce the law, such \nas supervisory authorities, courts and ombudsmen. \nThe legal framework can affect the value of an investment (e.g. in cases of fraud) and limit the scope for \ninvestors to assert their rights. This can be important if an issuer (see Glossary ) fails to meet its \nobligations.Swiss Bankers Association \u00b7 Risks Involved in T rading Financial Instruments111  General information\nEconomic risk\nChanges in a country\u2019s economic activity tend to have an impact on the prices of financial instruments. \nThis is referred to as economic risk.\nInterest rate risk\nInterest rate risk affects investors buying bonds, particularly when interest rates rise as this means that \nnew bonds will be issued with higher rates, making existing bonds with lower rates less attractive and \ncausing their prices to fall.\nInflation risk\nInflation risk is the risk that investors will suffer financial losses as the value of money declines. It is most \npronounced for long-term investments in foreign currencies. The central banks of countries with less \ndeveloped financial markets and low reserves of hard currency (see Glossary ) are sometimes unable to \nmeet their inflation targets. As a result, inflation and exchange rates in such countries can fluctuate more \nseverely than those in developed countries.\nSoft factor risks\nPrices of financial instruments do not just depend on \u201chard\u201d facts like a company\u2019s business performance \nand forecasts, they are also influenced by subjective \u201csoft\u201d factors such as expectations, fears and \nrumours. There is thus always a risk that the price of a financial instrument might fall in the short term due \nto soft factors, even though its value objectively remains intact.\nVolatility risk\nThe prices of financial instruments go up and down over time. Financial experts use the term \u201cvolatility\u201d \nto describe the range of these movements over a specific period. Volatility is a measure of market risk. \nThe higher a financial instrument\u2019s volatility, the more risky an investment it is, as its value could fall sharply.\nCluster risk\nCluster risks are caused by the way an investment portfolio is constructed. They arise when a single \nfinancial instrument, a small number of instruments or a single asset class makes up a large share of the \nportfolio. Portfolios with cluster risks can suffer greater losses than more diversified portfolios in a \nmarket downturn. Diversified portfolios spread their investments among different financial instruments \nand asset classes in order to reduce the overall risk of price fluctuations. When buying and selling financial \ninstruments, it is important to take account of portfolio structure and in particular to ensure sufficient \ndiversification.\nCluster risks at issuer (see Glossary ) country and sector level must be taken into consideration. A cluster \nrisk at issuer level exists, for example, in a portfolio containing a bond issued by Company X, shares in \nCompany X, a structured product with Company X as its underlying asset (see Glossary ) and an equity \nfund with 20\u2009% of its assets invested in that same Company X.Swiss Bankers Association \u00b7 Risks Involved in T rading Financial Instruments121  General information\nStructuring risk\nInvestments can be either direct or indirect (see section 1. 1). Indirect investments are made through an \ninvestment vehicle, which may be a collective investment scheme (such as a fund), a structured product \nor an option. The way this vehicle is structured can affect the investment\u2019s risk profile and might even \ncreate new risks.\nRisks involved in credit-financed investments\nSpecial risks apply to an investment portfolio that is partly or wholly financed by borrowing, usually via a  \nLombard loan secured against the investments in the portfolio.\n \u00b7Leverage effect\nInvestors need to be aware that using borrowed capital alters the risk\u2009/return profile of their portfolio. In \nsome cases, it can increase the expected return on the capital they have invested, but this higher return \ncomes with a higher investment risk due to the terms of the loan \u2013 interest costs and capital repayment \nthat are fixed. These fixed borrowing costs are set against uncertainty regarding the value of the invest -\nment and its return. Investments made with borrowed capital are said to have a leverage effect, meaning \nthat both potential returns and the risk of loss are higher. In addition to the risk that all of the invested \ncapital may be lost, additional conditions to repay the loan may mean that the investor loses even more \nthan was originally invested.\n \u00b7Margin requirements and liquidity squeezes\nIf the value of an investment falls below a certain level, the lender may require additional collateral to \nsecure the loan. This is known as a margin call. In such cases, the investor may be asked to repay some or \nall of the loan. If the investor does not provide the additional collateral or make the repayment, the \nlender may liquidate some or all of the assets pledged as collateral for the loan at an inopportune \nmoment, giving rise to an additional liquidity risk.\n \u00b7Currency risk\nLoans are often taken out in foreign currencies to take advantage of lower interest rates, in which case the \ncurrency risk (see Currency risk) must be taken into account as well.Swiss Bankers Association \u00b7 Risks Involved in T rading Financial Instruments131  General information\nSimplified illustration of a custody chainFig. 1\nSource: Swiss Bankers Association (SBA)Local custodian Bank Investor Local central custodian\nThird parties are often involved in derivatives transactions as well. Exchange-traded derivatives are either \ntraded directly on an exchange or via brokers (see Glossary ). Both exchange-traded and over-the-counter \n(OTC) derivatives (see section 3.3. 1) must be reported to a trade repository (see Glossary ).\nThe buying, selling and custody of financial instruments are subject to the local rules and market practices \napplicable to the external securities dealer or the market infrastructure, which has an effect on investors\u2019 \nrights.\nFinancial instruments held in custody abroad are subject to the applicable foreign laws, which may not \noffer the same protection as Swiss law. Investors\u2019 rights \u2013 including voting rights and rights pertaining to \nthe liquidation of a third-party custodian or central custodian \u2013 may therefore be affected or restricted.\nCollective custody\nBanks generally entrust financial instruments to a third-party custodian in their own name. With collective \ncustody, however, several investors\u2019 financial instruments are held collectively by the third-party custodian, \ni.e. they are not held separately for each individual investor. A bank is liable for its own actions, as well as \nfor any loss or damage caused by the third-party custodians it uses, under the applicable legal provisions, \nin particular those of the Swiss Code of Obligations, the Federal Act on Intermediated Securities and any \ncontractual agreements. 1.4 Risks attached to buying, selling and custody \u2013 \nparticularly abroad\nCustody chain\nIn addition to the investor\u2019s bank, other parties (financial intermediaries, see Glossary ) are usually \ninvolved in the buying, selling and custody of financial instruments and other assets. The bank will often \ncall on the services of a securities dealer (see Glossary ) for buying and selling, and custody is regularly \nhandled by a number of parties making up what is known as the custody chain. Within this chain, the bank \nnormally entrusts financial instruments to a local third-party custodian, which in turn holds them with a \ncentral custodian, either directly or via additional third-party custodians. Financial instruments are in \nprinciple held in custody in the issuer\u2019s (see Glossary ) country of domicile or in the country where they \nare most commonly traded on an exchange, although this does not have to be the case.Swiss Bankers Association \u00b7 Risks Involved in T rading Financial Instruments141  General information\nInsolvency\nIf a bank becomes insolvent, Swiss law \u2013 in particular the Banking Act and the Federal Act on Intermediated \nSecurities \u2013 requires in principle that any assets it holds in custody are kept separate from the bankruptcy \nassets for the benefit of its custody account clients. However, investors should bear in mind that insol-\nvency proceedings can delay the transfer of financial instruments to investors or other parties (usually \nfinancial intermediaries, see Glossary ). If a third-party custodian becomes insolvent, some countries\u2019 laws \nrequire in principle that the financial instruments it holds in custody for banks are kept separate (segre-\ngated, see Glossary ) from the bankruptcy assets. In some cases, however, financial instruments held in \ncustody may also be included in the bankruptcy assets.\nInvestors with assets held in custody abroad are therefore generally exposed to a country risk, which also \nconcerns the financial intermediary and financial market in question.\nDisclosure obligations\nA wide range of information may have to be disclosed when transactions in foreign financial instruments \nor Swiss financial instruments with a connection to foreign countries are executed and settled. This is the \ncase, for example, with investment funds that have asset classes in foreign currencies as well as with \ntrading locations and custody in foreign countries. Information may have to be disclosed to the financial \ninstitutions involved, financial market infrastructure providers and other third parties as well as authori-\nties and issuers (see Glossary ) of financial instruments. Such disclosure obligations are intended to \ncombat money laundering, terrorist financing, market abuse and insider trading, to apply sanctions, to \nensure good corporate governance or generally to comply with local rules. Banks are often unable to \nexecute transactions at all or to hold financial instruments in custody correctly without forwarding the \nrequired information. Disclosure may be required before or after a transaction or in connection with \ncustody.\nThe financial institutions and financial market infrastructure providers to which information must be \ndisclosed are primarily securities dealers, fund management companies, clearing houses, custodians and \ntrade repositories. In some cases, these may forward information disclosed to them to Swiss and foreign \nauthorities or other third parties. The same applies to the processing of cross-border payment transac -\ntions such as transferring the price of financial instruments bought or sold.\nInformation on disclosure\nInformation to be disclosed may include the following: name, date of birth, copy of passport, nationality \nand domicile, details of beneficial ownership, client or recipient, instructions and trade details, transaction \namount, current or prior holding of financial instruments, details of the economic background of specific \ntransactions and information on the origin of the money used, the duration of the banking relationship, \nrelationships with other involved parties, any representation relationships and any other required \ndocuments and information. Where companies are involved, information on their business activity, \nbusiness purpose, ownership structure, beneficial owners, corporate structure and number of employees \nmay be required, as may any other business-relevant information and documents. \nBanks are expressly authorised to transmit non-public information to certain foreign entities by \nArticle\u00a042c of the Financial Market Supervision Act (FINMASA). The Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Swiss Bankers Association \u00b7 Risks Involved in T rading Financial Instruments151  General information\nAuthority FINMA has published a circular on this topic as part of its supervisory practice (Circular 2017\u2009/\u20096 \n\u201cDirect transmission\u201d). For this purpose, banks obtain their clients\u2019 consent to bypass certain confidentiality \nrequirements, for example under banking secrecy or the Federal Act on Data Protection. They normally  \ndo so by including this in their general terms and conditions, terms and conditions of custody etc. or in \nthe form of a written waiver.\nInformation transmitted abroad and cross-border transactions are no longer protected under Swiss law \n(e.g. in terms of banking secrecy or data protection). Instead, they are subject to the provisions applicable \nin the foreign jurisdiction concerned, which may not offer the same level of protection. Foreign laws and \nofficial orders may require information to be forwarded to authorities or other third parties.\nIt must also be borne in mind that foreign laws can change quickly and that the conditions applicable to \nthe trading and custody of foreign financial instruments \u2013 the obligation to disclose the investor\u2019s \nidentity, for example \u2013 may change during the investment period. Investors are responsible for informing \nthemselves of the tax and legal implications of the financial instruments in which they wish to invest, \nregardless of which financial services they use (i.e. investment advice, portfolio management or execu-\ntion-only services).\n1.5 Tax treatment of financial instruments\nAs a rule, income from financial instruments and assets is taxed at different rates. For example, the tax \nrate on a financial instrument may depend on whether its income is recorded as interest or capital gains. \nTaxes and duties may also apply regardless of cash flows.\nForeign investments entail a risk of double taxation for countries that have not signed a double taxation \ntreaty with the investor\u2019s country of domicile. Foreign countries may additionally levy withholding taxes \nthat cannot be reclaimed in Switzerland.\nParticularly in the case of new and innovative forms of investment, the tax treatment can change during \nthe investment period, for instance if the applicable legislation and case law are incomplete or in the \nprocess of changing when the investment is made.\nFinally, it is conceivable that changes in tax law may affect the capital market as a whole. Even if the  \ntaxes actually payable remain the same, such changes may influence the prices of financial instruments. \nInvestors are advised to consult a tax expert in order to assess the tax implications of investments, \nincluding those accompanied by information documents claiming that they offer tax advantages or \neven exemption from tax.Swiss Bankers Association \u00b7 Risks Involved in T rading Financial Instruments161  General information\n1.6 Sustainability-related financial risks (ESG-risks) \nESG stands for environmental (e.g. energy and water consumption), social (e.g. employer appeal and \nsupply chain management) and governance (e.g. remuneration policy and company management). \nESG-risks are events or situations in these three areas that are currently having a negative impact  \non economic, cost or reputation factors, for example, and thus also on the value of a company or the \nmarket price of financial instruments or could potentially do so in future.  \nEnvironmental risks are commonly divided into two categories: physical risks and transition risks. \nPhysical risks include, for example, damage and costs arising from extreme weather events caused by \nclimate change, such as storms, flooding and heatwaves, which threaten or harm a company\u2019s economic \nactivities or assets. T ransition risks include regulatory risks, changes in consumer behaviour and liability  \nor legal risks. One example of a transition risk would be the introduction of a tax on carbon dioxide \nemissions, which could negatively affect a company\u2019s profitability and thus its enterprise value.\nSocial risks can arise, for example, from violations of employment standards, a lack of attention to \noccupational health and safety, poor product safety, failure to address social issues, unfair treatment of \nstaff or high staff turnover. \nGovernance risks, meanwhile, can arise from unequal treatment of shareholders, inadequate risk \nmanagement or control mechanisms, inappropriate remuneration systems or rule violations (e.g. corrup-\ntion), among other things. \nESG-risks can affect specific asset classes, regions, economic sectors and/or companies in different ways. \nFor instance, climate change, environmental destruction and the need to adopt more sustainable \nbusiness practices can lead to changes in the real economy that might create new risk factors for investors. \nInvestors, therefore, should always incorporate ESG-risks into their risk diversification decisions.\nESG-risks and characteristics can be integrated into asset management and investment advisory processes \nusing a range of different ESG-approaches, all of which are evolving rapidly. It is important for investors \nto understand that these approaches have different aims and that not all of them are geared to a measura-\nble positive impact on ESG-factors such as reducing pollution.Swiss Bankers Association \u00b7 Risks Involved in T rading Financial Instruments172  Financial instruments and their specific risks\n2 Financial instruments and their  \nspecific risks\nThis second part provides an overview of the characteristics and specific risks of the main types of \nfinancial instruments. More detailed explanations of individual financial instruments can be found in the \nthird and final part of this brochure.  \n2.1 Equity securities (shares, participation  \ncertificates and dividend rights certificates) \nWhat are equity securities?\nEquity securities include shares, participation certificates and dividend rights certificates. They embody a \nshare in the ownership of a company and confer certain rights on the holder in relation to that company, \nsuch as voting and profit-sharing rights and in some cases also pre-emption rights (preferential rights to \nbuy any newly issued securities). Equity securities are not normally redeemable, but they are tradable and \ntransferable on the secondary market.\nWhat risks are associated with equity securities?\nEquity securities are subject to a volatility risk that depends on a variety of factors, including the compa-\nny\u2019s financial health, the general economic situation and interest rate levels. They do not pay interest. \nInstead, they typically pay out a share of profit, for example in the form of a dividend set by the compa-\nny, usually in line with its business performance. Sometimes, however, no dividend is paid.\nEquity securities are also subject to an issuer risk (see Glossary ) in that a total loss is possible if the issuer \ngoes bankrupt, in which case holders of equity securities are only taken into consideration once the \ncompany has settled all other claims against it.Swiss Bankers Association \u00b7 Risks Involved in T rading Financial Instruments182  Financial instruments and their specific risks\n2.3 Money market products\nWhat are money market products?\nMoney market products are debt instruments (see Glossary ) issued as certificated or uncertificated \nsecurities (see section 2.2) for short-term financing purposes. They have terms of up to one year. The \npurchase or sale price is the nominal or face value minus the total interest accruing over the term.What risks are associated with bonds?\nThe price of a bond can fall during its term, in particular due to a lack of demand, rising interest rates or a \ndecline in the issuer\u2019s creditworthiness.\nBonds are subject to market, issuer, liquidity, interest rate and currency risks (see section 1.3). Holders of \na bond can lose some or all of their investment if the issuer goes bankrupt as bonds are not classed as \nprivileged claims \u2013 in fact, they are allocated to the third bankruptcy class (see Glossary ).\nMore detailed information on bonds can be found in section 3.1.2.2 Bonds\nWhat are bonds?\nFrom the issuer\u2019s perspective, bonds are a form of fixed-term borrowing. The issuer (borrower) normally \npays a fixed rate of interest at regular intervals. Most bonds are redeemed at the end of their term, and \nsome can be redeemed early. In addition to conventional bonds, there are special forms that, alongside \ntheir debt function, also have equity-like features from the issuing company\u2019s point of view. These \ninclude convertible, warrant and hybrid bonds (see section 3.1.2).\nWhat risks are associated with money market products?\nThe value of a money market product can fall during its term. Since the issuer is often a government, the \nissuer risk (see section 1.3) is usually lower than for other fixed-income investments (see Glossary ). \nHowever, there may be currency risks.Swiss Bankers Association \u00b7 Risks Involved in T rading Financial Instruments192  Financial instruments and their specific risks\n2.4 Collective investment schemes\nWhat are collective investment schemes? \nCollective investment schemes are pools of assets supplied by investors to be jointly invested on their \naccount. They make broadly diversified investments possible with a small amount of invested capital.\nCollective investment schemes come in many different forms and are extensively regulated in Switzer -\nland. In particular, they are subject to approval and supervision by the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory \nAuthority FINMA. The main form of collective investment scheme is the contractual investment fund. \nInvestors in Switzerland can choose from a wide range of foreign funds in addition to Swiss-domiciled \nones. Collective investment schemes may adopt various strategies: money market, equities, bonds, asset \nallocation, real estate, commodities or alternative investments. The legal documents constituting a fund \u2013  \nthe fund regulations, articles of association or fund contract \u2013 describe the investments it can make.\nWhat risks are associated with collective investment schemes?\nFunds are subject to the same market, volatility, country, currency, liquidity and issuer risks (see Glossary ) \nas the investments they make. The extent of specific risks depends on their investment restrictions, risk \ndiversification and use of investment techniques and derivatives.\nThe legal documents constituting a fund, as well as its prospectus and (where applicable) key information \ndocument, describe its risk profile in detail.\nMore detailed information on collective investment schemes can be found in section 3.2.Swiss Bankers Association \u00b7 Risks Involved in T rading Financial Instruments20Example of a buyerFig. 2\nThe buyer of an option has the right to buy a specified amount of an underlying from the seller (call \noption) or sell it to the seller (put option) at a predefined price (known as the strike price) on or before a \nset point in time (the expiry date). The price of this right is called the premium.\nSource: SBA2  Financial instruments and their specific risks\nCall\nPut\nUnderlyingProfit\nLossStrike Strike02.5 Options\nWhat are options?\nAn option is an agreement between a buyer and a seller conferring the right to buy or sell a specific \nunderlying asset (often referred to simply as the \u201cunderlying\u201d) at a predefined price at or before a specific \npoint in time (the expiry date). The agreed price applies regardless of the current market value on the \nexpiry date. Various types of underlying are possible:\n \u00b7Investment assets: e.g. shares, bonds, precious metals\n \u00b7Other instruments: currencies, interest rates, indices\n \u00b7Events: credit events, natural disastersSwiss Bankers Association \u00b7 Risks Involved in T rading Financial Instruments21Example of a sellerFig. 3\nThe seller (writer) of an option must sell the underlying to the buyer at the strike price (short call) or buy \nthe underlying from the buyer at the strike price (short put) on or before the expiry date, irrespective of \nthe current market value of the underlying, if the buyer chooses to exercise the option. The buyer pays \nthe seller a premium in exchange for this right.\nSource: SBA2  Financial instruments and their specific risks\nShort Call\nShort Put\nUnderlyingProfit\nLossPremium\n0\nWhat risks are associated with options?\nDifferent types of options are subject to different risks. A call option is said to be \u201cin the money\u201d when \nthe current market value of the underlying is above the strike price. A put option is in the money if the \ncurrent market value is below the strike price. Generally speaking, if the market value of the underlying \nfalls, so does the value of a call option. The value of a put option, meanwhile, tends to fall if the market \nvalue of the underlying rises. Normally, the less an option is in the money, the larger the fall in the option\u2019s \nvalue. In such cases, the value normally falls much more sharply close to the expiry date.\nThe value of a call option can drop even when the market value of the underlying remains unchanged or \nrises. This is the case, for instance, when the time value of the option (see Glossary ) falls, when supply and \ndemand factors are unfavourable or when changes in volatility have a greater effect than changes in \nmarket value.Swiss Bankers Association \u00b7 Risks Involved in T rading Financial Instruments222  Financial instruments and their specific risks\nIt must be borne in mind that options can lose value or even become completely worthless as their \nexpiry date approaches. From the buyer\u2019s point of view, this means a loss equal to the premium paid for \nthe option. The loss risk for the seller of a call option is theoretically unlimited.\nMore detailed information on options can be found in section 3.3.\n2.6 Structured products\nWhat are structured products?\nStructured products are issued either publicly or privately. Their redemption value depends on the \nperformance of one or more underlying assets, e.g. shares, interest rates, currencies or commodities. \nThey may have a fixed or unlimited term and consist of one or more components. They may also be \nadmitted to trading on an exchange.\nThe Swiss Structured Products Association (SSPA) categorises structured products into the following \nmain groups:\n \u00b7capital protection (see section 3.4. 1)\n \u00b7yield enhancement (see section 3.4.2)\n \u00b7participation (see section 3.4.3)\n \u00b7investment products with reference entities (see section 3.4.4 )\nWhat risks are associated with structured products?\nStructured products bear the risk that the issuer may become insolvent (issuer risk). Their value thus \ndepends not only on the performance of the underlying, but also on the creditworthiness of the issuer, \nguarantor or reference entity. This can change at any time during a structured product\u2019s term.\nIt is also important to consider a structured product\u2019s specific risk profile, which can either reduce or \nincrease the risks associated with individual underlyings. Depending on the type of structured product, \ntherefore, investors may aim to profit from rising, stable or falling prices. It is imperative that investors \ninform themselves precisely about the specific risks attached to a structured product before buying it. \nThis information can be found in the product documentation, the key information document or the \nprospectus.Swiss Bankers Association \u00b7 Risks Involved in T rading Financial Instruments232  Financial instruments and their specific risks\nMore detailed information on structured products can be found in section 3.4. and on the SSPA website \nat www.sspa.ch.\n2.7 Leverage products\nWhat are leverage products?\nLeverage products are normally regarded as a category of structured products, but this brochure treats \nthem as a separate product class because they differ significantly from other types of structured products. \nWhereas structured products are usually a combination of a conventional investment (such as a share or \nbond) and a derivative, leverage products \u201conly\u201d consist of a derivative or a combination of derivatives. \nBoth leverage products and structured products legally constitute a debt instrument with derivative \ncharacter, meaning that they are subject to a credit risk.\nLeverage products are geared to either investing speculatively or hedging risks. The leverage consists in \nthe fact that investors can participate disproportionately from rising or falling prices with a relatively \nsmall amount of invested capital. It is thus possible to profit from short-term trends in either direction.\nLeverage products are especially suitable for risk-friendly investors seeking to speculate over the short \nterm and for strategically hedging an existing investment or portfolio.Swiss Bankers Association \u00b7 Risks Involved in T rading Financial Instruments24Example: Mini-FutureFig. 4\nWith a mini-future, investors participate in the price of the underlying on a leveraged basis with a small \namount of invested capital, provided the price remains above a stop-loss level.\nSource: Swiss Structured Products Association (SSPA)\nExample: Constant Leverage certificateFig. 5\nWith a constant leverage certificate, investors participate in the price of the underlying on a leveraged \nbasis and thus profit disproportionately from rising (long) or falling (short) prices.\nSource: SSPA2  Financial instruments and their specific risks\nLong\nShort\nUnderlyingProfit\nLossStop-Loss Stop-Loss\nFinancing levelFinancing level0\nLong\nShort\nUnderlyingProfit\nLoss0Swiss Bankers Association \u00b7 Risks Involved in T rading Financial Instruments252  Financial instruments and their specific risks\nWhat risks are associated with leverage products?\nBecause of the leverage effect, the underlying must be monitored regularly and carefully, since leverage \nproducts can experience not only disproportionately large gains, but also disproportionately large losses \ncompared with the underlying.\nIn the worst-case scenario, all of the capital invested in a leverage product may be lost.\nWhat risks are associated with futures and forwards?\nFutures and forwards can involve special risks. Only investors who are familiar with these financial \ninstruments, have sufficient money available and are able to bear potential losses should invest in them.\nWith forward sales, the underlying must be delivered at the price originally agreed on if its market value \nhas since risen above the agreed price. The loss risk is thus equal to the difference between the two \nprices. Since there is theoretically no limit to how far the market value of the underlying can rise, the \npotential loss is also unlimited.\nThe forward sale of an underlying the seller does not own at the time the contract is signed is known as a \nshort sale. It entails a risk in that the seller may have to buy the underlying at a price higher than the \nagreed price in order to meet the delivery obligation on expiry.2.8 Futures and forwards\nWhat are futures and forwards?\nFutures and forwards are agreements whereby a buyer and a seller undertake to buy or sell a specific \nunderlying at a predefined price at a specific point in time (the expiry date). The obligation applies \nregardless of the current market value on the expiry date.\n \u00b7Futures are standardised contracts in terms of the quantity of the underlying and the expiry date  \nthat are traded on an exchange. Some futures can give rise to a delivery obligation even before the \nexpiry date.\n \u00b7Forwards, meanwhile, are not traded on an exchange. They can be either standardised or individually \nagreed between the buyer and seller.Swiss Bankers Association \u00b7 Risks Involved in T rading Financial Instruments262  Financial instruments and their specific risks\nConversely, with forward purchases, the buyer must take delivery of the underlying at the price originally \nagreed even if its market value has since fallen below the agreed price. The loss risk is thus equal to  \nthe difference between the two prices. The maximum loss therefore corresponds to the originally agreed \nprice. \nIn order to limit price fluctuations, an exchange may set price limits for certain contracts. Investors should \ninform themselves of such limits before investing in futures as it can be much more difficult or even \nimpossible to close out a contract if a price limit is reached.\nThe market for standardised forwards is transparent and often also liquid, so contracts can normally be \nclosed out without difficulty. There is no actual market for forwards agreed on individually, so they may \nonly be closed out with the counterparty\u2019s (see Glossary ) consent. Contracts featuring a combination of \ndifferent elements can entail significantly different risks, in particular if not all of the elements can be \nclosed out. Investors should thus consult their securities dealer (see Glossary ) for detailed information on \nthe special risks before entering into such contracts.\nMore detailed information on futures and forwards can be found in section 3.5.\n2.9 Financial instruments for financing or risk transfer \npurposes (credit and catastrophe derivatives)\nWhat are financial instruments for financing or risk transfer purposes (credit and catastrophe derivatives)?\nSome financial instruments are used mainly to transfer risks. These include credit and catastrophe \nderivatives, for which the underlying is an event such as a credit event (default on a loan or bond) or a \nnatural disaster. Credit derivatives come in the form of swaps, options or hybrid financial instruments \n(see Glossary ).Swiss Bankers Association \u00b7 Risks Involved in T rading Financial Instruments272  Financial instruments and their specific risks\n2.10  Offshore funds and hedge funds\nWhat are offshore funds and hedge funds?\nOffshore funds and hedge funds are collective investment schemes that are subject to no or only partial \nregulation and supervision. Hedge funds are free to choose the asset classes, markets \u2013 including \nhigh-risk countries \u2013 and trading methods they employ. They often have aggressive strategies and work \nwith investment techniques that decouple investment performance from the performance of the \nunderlying markets.What risks are associated with financial instruments for financing or risk transfer purposes?\nCredit and catastrophe derivatives are subject to liquidity risks because a lack of trading may make it \nimpossible to sell them before expiry.\nThe risks in a credit portfolio can be securitised and transferred to third parties (see Glossary > Asset-backed \nsecurity ) in the form of credit-linked notes, collateralised debt obligations or asset-backed securities.\nFurther information on credit derivatives can be found in section 3.1.3.\nWhat risks are associated with offshore funds and hedge funds?\nManagers of offshore funds and hedge funds often enjoy maximum flexibility in their investment deci-\nsions and are normally not bound by the rules on liquidity, redemption, avoiding conflicts of interest, fair \npricing, disclosure and use of leverage that apply to conventional funds. They also have limited liquidity. \nMore detailed information on offshore funds and hedge funds can be found in section 3.6.Swiss Bankers Association \u00b7 Risks Involved in T rading Financial Instruments282  Financial instruments and their specific risks\n2.11 Private Equity\nWhat is private equity?\nPrivate equity is a form of investment to provide risk capital financing for companies that either are not \nlisted on a stock exchange or (in exceptional cases) wish to delist. Investments are usually made at an \nearly stage in a company\u2019s development, when its chances of success are uncertain and the risks are \ntherefore high.\n2.12  Real Estate\nWhat are real estate investments?\nInvestments in real estate can be made directly or indirectly. Real estate comprises office buildings, retail \nand industrial premises, residential property and special real estate (such as hotels or hospitals). The \nvariables that determine the value of a property are its location and facilities and the variety of ways in \nwhich it can be used. Direct investments involve buying properties directly rather than investing via a \nsecurities dealer (see Glossary ).\nIndirect investments generally require a lower capital outlay than direct investments and can be listed  \non an exchange or unlisted. Examples of unlisted indirect investments include real estate funds (see \nsection 3.2.3 ), shares of real estate companies that are not traded on an exchange and certificates on real \nestate funds. Real estate funds can reduce risks by diversifying across geographical areas and real estate \ncategories. Listed indirect investments include real estate investment trusts (REITs), which make it possible to \ninvest in real estate without incurring certain disadvantages, such as illiquidity.What risks are associated with private equity?\nPrivate equity investments are not usually subject to regulation, in particular with regard to investor \nprotection. Because of this and their lack of transparency (e.g. limited disclosure of financial accounts or \nno publication), they entail higher risks for investors. This is especially true for private equity vehicles \ndomiciled in countries with comparatively relaxed legislation.\nPrivate equity investments involve considerable risks and can lead to substantial losses, including total \nlosses. They are also geared to the long term and often have highly limited liquidity.\nMore detailed information on private equity can be found in section 3.7 .Swiss Bankers Association \u00b7 Risks Involved in T rading Financial Instruments292  Financial instruments and their specific risks\n2.13  Precious metals\nWhat are precious metals?\nThe most common precious metals are gold, silver, platinum and palladium. It is possible to invest in \nthem either directly \u2013 by buying the physical metal or opening a precious metals account \u2013 or indirectly \n(see section 1. 1) \u2013 by buying fund units, derivatives or structured products linked to the price of a pre-\ncious metal. When investing directly in physical metals, investors can choose from different units of \nweight and levels of purity. Gold is normally present on European markets in the form of non-exchangea-\nble, numbered bars (or ingots) weighing 12.5\u2009kg each with a purity of 99.5 \u2013 99.99\u2009% and exchangeable \nbars weighing 25\u2009g, 500\u2009g or 1\u2009kg with 99.99\u2009% purity.\nCoins such as the South African Krugerrand and the Canadian Gold Maple Leaf are another means of \ninvesting in precious metals. On European markets, silver is normally traded in the form of numbered \nbars or ingots weighing around 30\u2009kg or 1\u2009kg, while platinum is traded as 1 kg or one-ounce bars and \npalladium as 1\u2009kg bars.\nInvestors who buy a physical metal acquire ownership rights. In the case of non-exchangeable bars, they \nown individual, numbered units. In the case of exchangeable (fungible) assets, they own the weight of \nmetal in the specified form, e.g. 1\u2009kg bars or a specific number of coins.What risks are associated with real estate investments?\nAnyone investing indirectly in real estate must consider the risks attached to the financial instrument in \nquestion. There are traditional, strictly regulated funds that invest in real estate, but indirect real estate \ninvestments can also have similar characteristics to hedge funds or private equity and thus entail higher \nrisks. Ultimately, physical assets \u2013 buildings and land \u2013 underlie all real estate investments. Each of these \nassets is unique, so there is no regulated trading.\nProperty markets are also frequently intransparent and require precise knowledge of local circumstances. \nIt is thus essential to involve local experts, which makes market access more difficult.\nReal estate sometimes reacts to interest rate changes in a similar way to bonds: when interest rates are \nlow, for instance, mortgages are cheap, and it is easy to generate above-average returns. Conversely, high \ninterest rates depress returns. Government tax incentives intended to promote home ownership and \nattractive lending conditions can also lead to excessively high prices.Swiss Bankers Association \u00b7 Risks Involved in T rading Financial Instruments302  Financial instruments and their specific risks\nWhat risks are associated with precious metals?\nWhen investors deposit physical precious metals with a bank, they are stored either by the bank itself or  \nby a custodian on behalf of the bank. Should the bank be liquidated, Swiss law prevents investors\u2019 physical \nmetal holdings from being included in the bankruptcy assets. The same applies in most comparable \njurisdictions.\nIf, on the other hand, an investor opts to open a precious metals account with a bank, the investor does \nnot have ownership rights but merely a claim to delivery of the physical metal. This means that the \ninvestor is exposed to the risk of default by the bank, for example if it goes bankrupt. Precious metals \naccounts are comparable to currency accounts, but they are denominated in the metal concerned  \n(e.g. XAU for gold) rather than a currency. \nPrecious metal prices can fluctuate considerably, particularly due to macroeconomic and market trends. \nPrecious metals, especially gold, are sometimes regarded as \u201csafe haven\u201d investments during periods of \nfinancial market turmoil. Other factors that can influence precious metal prices include production costs, \ndemand from non-financial sectors such as industry and the jewellery trade, monetary policy and central \nbanks\u2019 reserves.\n2.14  Commodities\nWhat are commodity investments?\nCommodities are physical goods that are produced via agriculture and mining, for example, and stand-\nardised for use as the underlying of a transaction. Derivatives on commodities such as energy sources \n(e.g. oil and coal), metals and agricultural produce are traded primarily on futures markets.\nInvestors can contract to buy or sell futures linked to the performance of a particular commodity, for \ninstance in order to buy a standardised quantity of the commodity at a specific future time for a prede-\nfined price. \nA common way for private individuals to invest indirectly in commodities is via structured products (see \nsection 2.6 ). Other ways to invest in commodities are commodity funds (see section 3.2.3) and financial \ninstruments that are not admitted to trading on an exchange such as over-the-counter swaps and \noptions. These are tailor-made products traded directly between a buyer and a seller. More detailed \ninformation on how forwards and futures work can be found in section 3.5.Swiss Bankers Association \u00b7 Risks Involved in T rading Financial Instruments312  Financial instruments and their specific risks\nWith commodity futures, investors may receive physical delivery of the commodity concerned on expiry \nunder certain circumstances, whereas structured products normally provide for cash payment. Investors \nwho prefer cash settlement must sell their futures before the expiry date. Financial products of this kind \nare therefore more risky than, for instance, equities or collective investment schemes.\nWhat risks are associated with commodity investments?\nThe price of commodities is influenced by various factors, including the following:\n \u00b7the relationship between supply and demand\n \u00b7climate and natural disasters\n \u00b7state programmes and regulations, national and international events\n \u00b7state intervention, embargoes and tariffs\n \u00b7movements in interest and exchange rates\n \u00b7trading in commodities and the corresponding contracts\n \u00b7provisions relating to monetary policy as well as trading, fiscal and currency controls\n \u00b7additional investment risks arising out of the combination of these variables\nCommodity investments are more volatile than conventional investments, and their returns can often fall \nsuddenly and sharply. The volatility of a commodity\u2019s price also affects the value and hence the price of \nfutures and forwards it underlies. For example, conventional oil futures are normally easy to trade, \nregardless of their term, but they can become illiquid if market activity is low. This can cause their prices \nto fluctuate significantly, which is a typical feature of commodities. \n2.15  Investments in cryptocurrencies and tokens\nWhat are investments in cryptocurrencies and tokens?\nIn an initial coin offering (ICO), investors transfer financial assets to the ICO organiser, usually in the form \nof cryptocurrencies. In return, they receive blockchain- based \u201ccoins\u201d or \u201ctokens\u201d. These are created and \nstored in a distributed system using a specially developed blockchain or smart contracts (see Glossary ) \non an existing blockchain (see FINMA Guidance 04\u2009/\u20092017). The tokens issued can have different func -\ntions. They can serve as a simple means of payment (cryptocurrency) or confer the right to use a service \nor a right of ownership in relation to the ICO organiser.\nCryptocurrencies are a digital means of making cashless payments independently of third parties such as \nbanks. T ransactions in cryptocurrencies are handled and recorded on a distributed and cryptographically \nsecured blockchain.Swiss Bankers Association \u00b7 Risks Involved in T rading Financial Instruments322  Financial instruments and their specific risks\nWhat risks are associated with investments in cryptocurrencies and tokens?\nThe specific risks associated with investments in cryptocurrencies and tokens include high volatility (see \nGlossary ) due to their still low market capitalisation, speculation and a continually changing legal frame-\nwork in various countries. T okens often involve investing in a start-up, which brings a high risk of default. \nInvestments in ICOs are also subject to the risk of fraud, for example due to the absence or inadequacy \nof direct regulation.\nCryptocurrency holdings can only be accessed using a digital key and are thus blocked if the key is lost.\nInvestors who are interested in this type of investment opportunity are advised to study technical and \nregulatory developments in the field carefully and in particular to consult the relevant publications from \nthe Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority FINMA.T okens that confer ownership rights qualify as securities (see Glossary ) and are thus subject to the \napplicable laws, including the Anti-Money Laundering Act (AMLA) and the Financial Market Infrastructure \nAct (FMIA). Swiss Bankers Association \u00b7 Risks Involved in T rading Financial Instruments333 Detailed explanations of individual \nfinancial instruments\nThis section complements the information in the first two sections with more detailed explanations and \nillustrations of selected financial instruments.\n3.1 Bonds\n3.1.1  Convertible and warrant bonds\nA convertible bond is a fixed-income security that normally bears interest at an agreed nominal rate with \nno adjustment for inflation. It gives the holder the right to convert it within a predefined period and at a \npredefined ratio into an equity instrument from the same issuer, e.g. a share. If this conversion right is not \nexercised, the bond falls due for repayment at the end of its term. Convertible bonds are sometimes \nused as a means of exchanging shares between the shareholders of two companies that are merging, in \nwhich case they are known as exchangeable bonds. Instead of a conversion right, warrant bonds comprise \nan option, subject to certain conditions, to buy equity instruments in addition to the bond. Convertible \nbonds that must be converted into equity instruments at a specific time or under specific conditions are \ncalled mandatory convertible bonds. Mandatory convertible bonds issued by a bank are called contin-\ngent convertible bonds (CoCos).3  Detailed explanations of individual financial instruments\nSpecial risks\nWhen buying convertible bonds, investors should always consider whether conversion is mandatory  \nand, if so, what conditions are attached. The right to convert a bond or exercise an option may also  \nbe restricted.\n3.1.2  Hybrid bonds\nHybrid bonds are debt instruments with certain equity-like elements, such as no fixed term, the possibility \nof postponing or cancelling periodic interest payments or \u2013 like equity securities \u2013 lower priority if the \nissuer is liquidated. Banks and insurers tend to qualify hybrid bonds as regulatory capital, while rating \nagencies can sometimes attribute them to the issuer\u2019s equity, depending on their structure. This makes \nthem attractive for industrial companies as well.Swiss Bankers Association \u00b7 Risks Involved in T rading Financial Instruments343  Detailed explanations of individual financial instruments\nSpecial risks\nThe overview below is limited to the characteristic features and risks of the most commonly issued types \nof hybrid bond. Investors are advised to consult the term sheet or key information document before \nmaking a decision.\nExamples of hybrid bonds\nIssuers: banks\nAdditional Tier 1 bonds\nAdditional Tier 1 bonds are subordinated (lower-ranked) bonds with no fixed term that are issued by \nbanks to bolster their core capital ratio. They can be repaid by the issuer at face value on the same date \neach year. Their interest rate is fixed until the first possible repayment date and then usually adjusted \nevery five years. Under certain circumstances, the interest (coupon) payment (e.g. quarterly or annually) \nmust be suspended. Unpaid coupons are not carried forward. The value of the bonds may be partially or \ntotally written off, or the bonds may be converted into equity instruments, when certain conditions are \nmet: the issuer\u2019s Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) ratio falls below a predefined threshold, e.g. 5.125\u2009% or 7\u2009%; \nthe supervisory authority determines that the issuer is at risk of insolvency; or the issuer reaches the \npoint of non-viability (PONV) and receives a commitment for emergency state support.\nSince their mandatory conversion is contingent on a particular condition, Additional Tier 1 bonds are also \nknown as contingent convertibles or CoCos (see section 3.1.1 ).\nTier 2 bonds\nTier 2 bonds are subordinated bonds with a limited term that are issued by banks to bolster their overall \ncapital ratio. Some Tier 2 bonds can be called by the issuer five years before the end of their term. In \ncontrast to Additional Tier 1 bonds, interest payments cannot be suspended. If the supervisory authori -\nty determines that the issuer is at risk of insolvency, or if the issuer reaches the point of non-viability \n(PONV) and receives a commitment for emergency state support, the entire value of the bonds is \nwritten off (resulting in a total loss), or the bonds are converted into equity instruments.\n \nBail-in bonds\u2009/\u2009gone-concern capital\nBail-in bonds are issued as loss-bearing debt instruments in the event of insolvency measures. They are \nintended to ensure that a systemically important bank that has collapsed can make an orderly exit from \nthe market and that systemically important services can be maintained. When a failed bank is Swiss Bankers Association \u00b7 Risks Involved in T rading Financial Instruments353  Detailed explanations of individual financial instruments\nrestructured or wound up, bail-in bonds can be converted to equity or their nominal value reduced. In \norder to make them clearly distinct from conventional bonds, which have \u201cpreferred senior\u201d or \u201csenior \nunsecured\u201d rank, bail-in bonds must be given a lower rank either structurally \u2013 by being issued (see \nGlossary ) by a non-operating group holding company \u2013 or contractually. A new rank, \u201cnon-preferred \nsenior\u201d, has therefore been created for them.\nIssuers: insurers\nInsurers also issue hybrid bonds to improve their regulatory capital ratios and exert a positive influence \non rating agencies\u2019 assessments. As a rule, these bonds have a lower rank and a very long or unlimited \nterm with an option for the issuer to repay them. Bonds that are not repaid have their interest rate reset \nat predetermined times. Coupon payments may be suspended and do not always have to be carried \nforward. \nHybrid bonds issued by insurers do not normally have loss-absorbing features \u2013 write-off or conversion \nto equity \u2013 prior to bankruptcy. However, there are exceptions from both Swiss and European issuers, so \nit is important to consult the product documentation before making a decision.\nIssuers: industrial companies\nIndustrial companies issue hybrid bonds to strengthen their capital ratios and\u2009/\u2009or improve their ratings. \nAs a rule, the bonds have a lower rank, an unlimited term and an option for the issuer to repay them. \nBonds that are not repaid have their interest rate reset at predetermined times, usually with a margin \nrelative to the original credit spread. Coupon payments may be suspended. \nIn addition to the usual repayment arrangements, industrial companies can normally repay their hybrid \nbonds at any time at face value if certain factors (such as their financial reporting, rating or tax burden) \nundergo negative changes.\n3.1.3  Asset-backed securities (ABSs)\nWith asset-backed securities (ABSs), risks, for instance those attached to a group of debt claims, are \ntransferred to a special-purpose vehicle (SPV). The SPV finances this transaction by issuing bonds backed \nby a portfolio or a pool of assets, hence the term \u201casset-backed\u201d. If the assets backing a bond are mort -\ngages, it is called a mortgage-backed security (MBS). Many other types of ABS exist, and there is no \nstandard structure or terminology. Two examples are collateralised debt obligations (CDOs) and collater -\nalised loan obligations (CLOs). The individual portfolio components would be unattractive or even \nunobtainable in this form for individual investors. Creating a portfolio makes it possible to combine and \nsell a range of assets and risks.Swiss Bankers Association \u00b7 Risks Involved in T rading Financial Instruments363  Detailed explanations of individual financial instruments\nSpecial risks\nThe risk level of ABSs always depends on the issuer \u2013 the SPV \u2013 as well as the quality of the portfolio and \nthe specific structure of the security. For example, if additional assets (e.g. blocked credit balances on \nreserve accounts) are created outside the portfolio to account for certain scenarios, these ensure the \nagreed payment flows as well as those that are important for the overall transaction. This reduces the risk \nof default on the payment flows considerably and also reduces the overall risk of default on the periodic \ninterest payments or the repayment of the ABS at the end of its term. The SPV routinely issues several \nclasses of ABS shares with different ranks, credit ratings and risk premiums. If it does not have sufficient \nfunds to meet all its obligations when they fall due, the available funds are paid out by rank. The lower \nranks bear any losses, while the higher ranks might be covered in full. In addition, ABS holders may be \ngranted a security interest in the SPV\u2019s assets, which could reduce their loss risk.\nEven if a pool or portfolio is created, a lack of diversification can lead to a cluster risk.\nIf the SPV is domiciled outside Switzerland, attention should be paid in particular to the issuer risk  \n(see Glossary ) and the quality of state supervision of SPVs in the domicile country. Classes with higher \nrisk premiums (and thus higher yields) typically also have a higher risk of default than those with lower  \nrisk premiums.\n3.2 Collective investment schemes\n3.2.1  Swiss collective investment schemes\nSwiss collective investment schemes are governed by the Collective Investment Schemes Act (CISA), \nwhich recognises the following categories of collective investment scheme:\nContractual and company-law collective investment schemes\nThe main form of collective investment scheme in Switzerland is the contractual investment fund. Other \nforms are investment companies with variable capital (SICAVs), investment companies with fixed capital \n(SICAFs) and limited partnerships for collective investment.\nWith a contractual investment fund, the relationships between the investors, the fund management \ncompany and the custodian bank are set out in a fund contract. The fund management company manag -\nes the fund on behalf of the investors. It makes the investment decisions, keeps the accounts and \nperforms all administrative tasks. The custodian bank holds the fund\u2019s assets in custody. It takes care of \npayments and is responsible for issuing and redeeming fund units. Contractual investment funds are \nopen-ended funds, i.e. investors have the right to terminate the contractual relationship at any time by \nredeeming their fund units at the net asset value (NAV). New investors can also buy into the fund.Swiss Bankers Association \u00b7 Risks Involved in T rading Financial Instruments373  Detailed explanations of individual financial instruments\nFund management companies, SICAVs, SICAFs and limited partnerships are comprehensively regulated, \nrequire authorisation from FINMA and are supervised by FINMA. The assets of a contractual collective \ninvestment scheme under Swiss law are segregated (see Glossary ) in favour of investors if the fund \nmanagement company goes bankrupt. Such segregation is not required for SICAVs, SICAFs and limited \npartnerships as they are legally separate companies.\nOpen-ended collective investment schemes\nContractual investment funds and SICAVs are open-ended collective investment schemes. This means \nthat investors are in principle entitled to redeem their units at any time, and new investors can invest into \nthem at any time. Depending on their investment policy, however, there may be certain restrictions on \nthe right to redeem units at any time.\nClosed-ended collective investment schemes\nSICAFs and limited partnerships for collective investment are closed-ended collective investment \nschemes. This means that investors have no fundamental legal right to redeem their units.\nSecurities funds and other funds for traditional and non-traditional investments\nOpen-ended collective investment schemes under Swiss law are divided into the following categories \naccording to their investment guidelines: securities funds, other funds for traditional investments, other \nfunds for alternative investments (see Glossary ) and real estate funds.\nSecurities funds invest in securities or rights issued on a large scale and traded on an exchange or another \nregulated market that is open to the public. They are intended for investments in liquid financial instru-\nments and can only invest in other financial instruments to a limited extent.\nOther funds for traditional investments and for alternative investments are subject to less strict invest -\nment rules than securities funds. They also have more scope than securities funds as regards their use of \ninvestment techniques and derivatives.\n3.2.2  Foreign collective investment schemes\nThe legal structure and investment rules of foreign investment funds are determined by the laws that \napply in their respective countries. Funds that comply with the EU Directive on Undertakings for Collec -\ntive Investment in T ransferable Securities (UCITS) are especially common. The Directive sets out require-\nments in terms of organisation, types of instrument used and liquidity that funds must meet in order to \nbe sold to a broad spectrum of investors.\n3.2.3 Investment strategies of collective investment schemes\nThe investment opportunities open to collective investment schemes vary according to their legal form \nand category. The investment strategy set out in a collective investment scheme\u2019s legal documentation \n(fund regulations or articles of association, depending on the legal form) defines the investments it can Swiss Bankers Association \u00b7 Risks Involved in T rading Financial Instruments383  Detailed explanations of individual financial instruments\nExamples of investment strategies\nMoney market funds\nMoney market funds invest in short-term, fixed-income instruments and are suitable for short-term \ninvestment purposes.\nEquity funds\nEquity funds invest mainly in shares. They are normally categorised by geographical focus (country-specific, \nregional or global), sector or theme (e.g. banks, pharmaceuticals, technology) or company size (small, \nmedium and large caps). Equity funds have high potential for returns over the long term but also a high \nvolatility risk. They are therefore suited to investors with a long-term focus who wish to profit from the \neconomic growth of one or more countries or sectors. \nBond funds\nBond funds invest mainly in bonds with fixed or variable coupons, convertible bonds and warrant bonds. \nThey are categorised primarily by currency, credit rating and length of term. They are suited to investors \nwith a medium- to long-term focus seeking more regular income from coupon payments.\nAsset allocation funds\nAsset allocation funds invest in a range of different asset classes, e.g. shares, bonds and real estate. Also \nknown as portfolio, mixed or strategy funds, they pursue specific strategies. They offer a standardised \nform of asset management tailored to investors\u2019 individual objectives and risk tolerance, allowing them to \ndiversify risks in line with their risk profile for a relatively small invested capital.\nReal estate funds\nReal estate funds typically buy investment properties such as apartment blocks or commercial premises. \nThey offer diversification benefits thanks to their low correlation (see Glossary ) to bonds and shares. The \ndownside is poor liquidity, which may limit the scope for redeeming units of real estate funds. For more \ninformation on real estate investments, see section 2.12.\nCommodity funds\nCommodity funds make it possible to invest in all the major commodities. This allows investors to diversify \ntheir portfolios and enjoy protection against inflation by investing in real assets. The risks involved are  \nin particular the high volatility (see Glossary ) of some commodity prices, general risks arising from  \nunexpected supply\u2009/\u2009demand situations and geopolitical risks. Commodity funds are suited to investors make. Collective investment schemes\u2019 strategies are geared first and foremost to risk diversification. \nBelow are some examples of possible investment strategies.Swiss Bankers Association \u00b7 Risks Involved in T rading Financial Instruments393  Detailed explanations of individual financial instruments\nwho are prepared to accept large price fluctuations. For more information on commodity investments, \nsee section 2.14 and section 3.6.\nLiquid alternatives\nLiquid alternatives are regulated investment funds with alternative investment strategies that differ from \nthose of traditional funds but still meet the requirements of the EU\u2019s UCITS Directive. These strategies \nare more like those of offshore funds and hedge funds and use a variety of investment instruments. For \nmore information on offshore funds and hedge funds, see section 2.10 . Liquid alternatives are more \nstrictly regulated, more transparent and more liquid than offshore funds and hedge funds. Investors can \nuse them to diversify their investment strategy thanks to their low correlation to equity and bond \nmarkets. They are also a means of investing in alternative risk premiums, which are largely free of tradi-\ntional market risks.\nActively managed investment funds\nWith actively managed investment funds, the fund manager chooses the mix of asset classes and individual \nsecurities in accordance with specific criteria, continually monitors the portfolio and adjusts it as required. \nThe fund\u2019s performance is measured against a reference index known as the benchmark, and the fund \nmanager attempts to add value for investors by constructing a portfolio that outperforms the benchmark.\nPassively managed investment funds and ETFs\nPassively managed investment funds, also called index funds, track a market index, which significantly \nreduces management costs. Their investment decisions are essentially determined by changes in the \nindex. Passively managed investment funds thus offer a simple and cost-effective way of ensuring broad \ndiversification. Exchange-traded funds (ETFs) normally track an index, e.g. a share, bond, money market, \nreal estate, hedge fund, currency or commodity index. They offer the advantage of being easy to trade.\n3.2.4 Funds of funds and multi-manager funds\nInvestment funds that invest in other funds (target funds) rather than individual securities are known as \nfunds of funds. The target funds can invest in a wide range of securities.\nMulti-manager funds spread their investments among a number of fund managers covering different \ninvestment styles, markets and financial instruments. Investors can achieve a higher level of risk diversifi-\ncation by investing in funds of funds and multi-manager funds, but the costs are generally higher due to \nthe costs generated by the various underlying funds.Swiss Bankers Association \u00b7 Risks Involved in T rading Financial Instruments403  Detailed explanations of individual financial instruments\nExample: Buying a call optionFig. 6\nSource: SBACall-Option\nShareProfit\nLossPremium\u2009=\u20091Share priceLeverage due to small amount of\ninvested capital\nThe option gives the buyer the right  \nto buy a share at a price of 10.\nInvested capital (premium) =  1\nCalculation:\nThe share price is 12.

It allows investors to profit disproportionately from increases (call \noption) or decreases (put option) in the price of the underlying.Swiss Bankers Association \u00b7 Risks Involved in T rading Financial Instruments413  Detailed explanations of individual financial instruments\n3.3.1  Types of options\nWarrants\nWarrants are options in securitised form that are traded on an exchange or over the counter. Exchange-  \ntraded warrants frequently involve bilateral settlement without the involvement of a central clearing \nhouse. Normal options are standardised as regards the strike price, ratio of options to underlying and \nterm (see section 2.7). With a warrant, the issuer can determine these itself, however it usually does in  \nline with investors\u2019 preferences in order to ensure sufficient demand for the warrant.\nExchange-traded options\nExchange-traded options are not issued as securities but are traded on an exchange and settled via a \ncentral clearing house. The exchange or central clearing house is a counterparty (see Glossary ) in the \ntransaction, whereas in a warrant transaction the issuer is the counterparty itself.\nOver-the-counter (OTC) options\nOTC options are neither securitised nor traded on-exchange. They are agreed directly off-exchange \nbetween the seller and the buyer. Investors who wish to cancel (close out) an option of this type before \nthe expiry date must make a corresponding offsetting trade with the counterparty.\nAmerican-style options\nAmerican-style options can in principle be exercised on any trading day up to the expiry date.\nEuropean-style options\nEuropean-style options can only be exercised on the expiry date, in other words the date set out in  \nthe contract. However, this does not normally affect their tradability on the secondary market (e.g. via  \nan exchange).\n3.3.2  Margin cover\nAn investor who sells an option must deposit either the requisite quantity of the underlying or another \nform of collateral for the entire duration of the contract. The amount of this collateral or margin is \ndetermined by the securities dealer (see Glossary ). The exchange stipulates a minimum margin for \nexchange-traded options (see above).\nIf the margin cover proves insufficient, the securities dealer can demand additional collateral. This is \nknown as a margin call. If the investor cannot provide the collateral quickly enough, the securities dealer \nmay unilaterally close out the option, in which case the investor loses the opportunity to profit from a \nfavourable trend in the underlying up to expiry.\n Swiss Bankers Association \u00b7 Risks Involved in T rading Financial Instruments423  Detailed explanations of individual financial instruments\nExample: Sale of a covered call optionFig. 7\nThe investor buys an underlying (a share, bond or currency) and at the same time sells (or writes) a call \noption on it. The investor receives a premium for the option, which reduces the loss incurred if the price \nof the underlying falls sharply. By the same token, however, the potential return from any increase in \nmarket value is limited to the option\u2019s strike price.\nSource: SBAShort Call\nPerformance\nUnderlyingProfit\nPremium\n0\nLoss3.3.3  Settlement\nWhere a call option provides for physical delivery (settlement), the investor can require the option seller \nto deliver the underlying when the option is exercised. With a put option, the option seller is obliged to \nbuy the underlying from the investor.\nIf an option provides for cash settlement, the option buyer is only entitled to a sum of money corre-\nsponding to the difference between the strike price and the current market value of the underlying.\n3.3.4  Traditional and synthetic covered options\nWith traditional covered options, the investor must deposit the underlying as collateral and is also \nreferred to as the covered writer.\nSynthetic covered options are based on the idea of replicating a traditional covered option with a single \ntransaction. The simultaneous purchase of the underlying and sale (writing) of the call option are effected \nusing derivatives. The purchase price of this type of financial instrument is equal to the price of the \nunderlying minus the premium received on selling the call option. The instrument can thus be sold at a \nlower price than its underlying.

A put \noption is in the money if the current market value of the underlying is below the strike price. If an option \nis in the money before expiry, it has an intrinsic value.\nOut of the money\nA call option is out of the money if the current market value of the underlying is below the strike price.  \nA put option is out of the money if the current market value of the underlying is above the strike price.  \nIn this case, the option has no intrinsic value.\nAt the money\nIf the current market value of the underlying is the same as the strike price, the option is at the money \nand has no intrinsic value.\nSource: SBA3.3.5  Value of an option\nThe price of an option depends on its intrinsic value and on what is referred to as the time value (see \nGlossary ). The latter is determined by a variety of factors, including the option\u2019s remaining term and the \nvolatility of the underlying. The time value reflects the chance that the option will be in the money. It is \nhigher for options with a long duration and a very volatile underlying and for options that are at the \nmoney. An option can be in the money, out of the money or at the money.\nLong Call\nUnderlyingProfit\nLossPremium0\nAt the moneyOut of the moneyIn the moneySwiss Bankers Association \u00b7 Risks Involved in T rading Financial Instruments443  Detailed explanations of individual financial instruments\n3.3.6  Special risks\nAs the seller (writer) of a covered call option\nIf an investor sells a call option and holds the requisite quantity of the underlying, the call option is \ndescribed as covered. If the current market value of the underlying exceeds the strike price, the investor \nloses out on the capital gain as a result of having to deliver the underlying to the buyer at the strike price, \nrather than selling the underlying at the (higher) market value. The investor must have full power of \ndisposal over the underlying if there is a chance that the option will be exercised. The underlying must \nnot be pledged for other purposes, otherwise the risks are essentially the same as for selling (writing) an \nuncovered call option (see next paragraph).\nAs the seller (writer) of an uncovered call option\nIf an investor sells a call option but does not hold the requisite quantity of the underlying, the call option \nis described as uncovered. The loss risk for an option with physical delivery (see Glossary ) is made up  \nof the difference between the price the investor must pay for the underlying and the strike price the buyer \npays for it \u2013 minus the premium the buyer paid for the option. The loss risk for an option with cash \nsettlement is made up of the difference between the price of the underlying and the strike price \u2013 minus \nthe premium the buyer paid for the option.\nSince the market value of the underlying can move well above the strike price, the loss risk cannot be \ndetermined and is theoretically unlimited.\nWith American-style options in particular, investors must also be prepared for the possibility of the option \nbeing exercised in the midst of a highly unfavourable market situation, resulting in a heavy loss. Where there \nis an obligation to provide physical delivery, it may be very expensive or even impossible to acquire the \nunderlying.\nInvestors must therefore be aware that the potential loss can be far greater than the value of the collateral \n(margin) deposited either when entering into the contract or thereafter.\nAs the seller (writer) of a put option\nAn investor selling a put option must be prepared for substantial losses if the market value of the \nunderlying falls below the strike price that must be paid to the seller. The loss risk in this case is made up \nof the difference between these two values minus the premium the buyer paid for the option. \nAn investor selling an American-style put option with physical delivery undertakes to buy the underlying \nat the strike price when the buyer exercises the option, even if the underlying can only be sold with \nconsiderable difficulty or at a heavy loss or cannot be sold at all. The potential losses can thus be far \ngreater than the value of any collateral (margin) that has been deposited. The maximum loss is equal to \nthe strike price multiplied by the quantity of underlying that must be bought.Swiss Bankers Association \u00b7 Risks Involved in T rading Financial Instruments453  Detailed explanations of individual financial instruments\n3.3.7  Option strategies and special options\nIf two or more options with the same underlying but strategic differences \u2013 e.g. in terms of type (call or \nput), ratio, strike price, expiry or transaction (purchase or sale) \u2013 are combined, this is referred to as an \noption strategy.\nGiven the many possible combinations, the risks involved in any particular case cannot be covered in \nevery detail in this brochure. Investors should inform themselves about the specific risks by reading the \nproduct\u2019s legal documentation or key information document before selecting a strategy.\nExotic options\nUnlike the \u201cplain vanilla\u201d put and call options described above, exotic options are linked to additional \nconditions and agreements. They come in the form of tailor-made OTC options (see Glossary ) or as \nwarrants.\nGiven the special composition of exotic options, their price movements can vary markedly from those of \ntheir \u201cplain vanilla\u201d counterparts. There is no limit to the possible structures for exotic options. The risks \nassociated with individual exotic options cannot be described exhaustively here.\nThe examples of exotic options listed below can be broadly divided into two categories: path-dependent \noptions and options on multiple underlyings.With covered options\nCovered options do not contain a hedge against falls in the market value of the underlying. However, \nwriting a traditional, covered call option or factoring the proceeds from writing a call option into the price \nof a synthetic covered option reduces any loss on the underlying\u2019s market value compared with a direct \ninvestment in the underlying. In effect, the option premium limits any loss on the market value of the \nunderlying. \nEither cash settlement or physical delivery of the underlying takes place on the expiry date. If the market \nvalue of the underlying on expiry is higher than the strike price, the holder of an option with cash settle-\nment receives a specified cash amount.\nIf the market value of the underlying is lower than the strike price, the holder of an option with physical \ndelivery receives the underlying and thus bears the full risk associated with it.Swiss Bankers Association \u00b7 Risks Involved in T rading Financial Instruments463  Detailed explanations of individual financial instruments\nKnock-in barrier optionFig. 9\nExercise rights for knock-in barrier options only arise if the market value of the underlying reaches a fixed \nthreshold (barrier) within a specified period.\nQuelle: SBVgPath-dependent options\nWith path-dependent options, in contrast to \u201cplain vanilla\u201d options, the market value of the underlying is \nnot only important when the option expires or is exercised. Fluctuations in the market value of the \nunderlying during the term of the option must also be taken into account when contemplating such an \ninvestment. The main types of path-dependent options are outlined below.\nExamples of path-dependent options:\nPerformance\nUnderlyingProfit\nLossPremium0\nBarrier levelSwiss Bankers Association \u00b7 Risks Involved in T rading Financial Instruments473  Detailed explanations of individual financial instruments\nKnock-out barrier optionFig. 10\nExercise rights for knock-out barrier options become invalid if the market value of the underlying reaches \na fixed threshold (barrier) within a specified period.\n  \nIf the barrier is between the market value of the underlying at the time the option was entered into and \nthe strike price, the option is referred to as a kick-in or kick-out barrier option.\nDouble-barrier options have both an upper and a lower barrier and may take the form of knock-in or \nknock-out barrier options.\nInvestors buying a barrier option must be aware that their exercise rights only take effect (with a knock-in\u2009/\u2009  \nkick-in option) or become entirely and irrevocably invalid (with a knock-out\u2009/\u2009kick-out option) when the \nmarket value of the underlying reaches the barrier.\nAccumulator and decumulator structures of barrier options\nAn accumulator structure comprises a series of barrier options allowing the investor to buy (accumulate)  \na specific nominal value of a currency or a specific quantity of an underlying at a predefined strike price \nduring a specific period. A decumulator structure is the opposite, allowing the investor to sell (decumu-\nlate) the underlying.\nAs long as the underlying does not break through the knock-out barrier, the investor accumulates the \npredefined quantity of the underlying in stages up to the end of the term. The investor has full power of \ndisposal over the underlying (and can therefore sell it) as soon as each option is exercised. If the knock-\nout barrier is reached, the whole structure expires prematurely, and no further options can be exercised.\nAccumulator structures often include an additional multiplier, e.g. a multiple of 1.5 or 2 times the nominal \nquantity of the underlying is bought, provided the current market value (spot price) is below the strike Performance\nUnderlyingProfit\nLossPremium0\nBarrier levelSwiss Bankers Association \u00b7 Risks Involved in T rading Financial Instruments48Payout optionFig. 113  Detailed explanations of individual financial instruments\nprice. A lower strike price compensates investors for the uncertainty over the effective accumulation \nquantity, which depends on the performance of the underlying and the term of the structure. Investors \ncan thus benefit from a lower purchase price.\nPerformance\nUnderlyingProfit\nLossPremium0\nFixed value\nPayout options entitle investors to receive a premium that is fixed in advance.\n  \nIn the case of a digital or binary option, the investor receives payment if the market value of the underly -\ning reaches a fixed value either once during a specified time period (one-touch digital option) or precisely \non the expiry date (all-or-nothing option). For the one-touch digital option, the premium is paid either \nimmediately when the barrier is reached or on the expiry date (lock-in option). If the value is not reached \nduring the term, the option expires with no value.\nWith a lock-out or no-touch option, the investor only receives the fixed payment if the market value of \nthe underlying does not reach the agreed barrier during a specified time period, otherwise the option \nexpires with no value.\nInvestors selling a payout option must pay the fixed amount if the market value of the underlying \nreaches or fails to reach the barrier, regardless of whether or to what extent the option is in the money \nwhen it is exercised or expires. This means that the amount owed can be considerably larger than the \noption\u2019s intrinsic value.\nAsian options\nAsian options involve calculating the average market value of the underlying over a specified time period. \nThis average is used to determine the underlying\u2019s value in the case of an average-rate option and to \ncalculate the strike price in the case of an average-strike option.Swiss Bankers Association \u00b7 Risks Involved in T rading Financial Instruments493  Detailed explanations of individual financial instruments\nContingent optionsFig. 12The calculation of the average value of the underlying for an average-rate option can result in the value \nof the option on the expiry date being considerably lower for the buyer and considerably higher for the \nseller than the difference between the strike price and the current market value on expiry.\nWith average-strike options, meanwhile, the average strike price of a call option can be considerably \nhigher than the price originally set. Conversely, the strike price of a put option can be lower than the price \noriginally set.\nLookback options\nWith a lookback option, the market value of the underlying is recorded periodically over a specified \ntime period.\nThe strike price of a strike lookback option is determined by the lowest value (call option) or the highest \nvalue (put option) of the underlying.\nThe strike price of a price lookback option remains unchanged. Instead, the option value is calculated \nfrom the highest value (call option) or the lowest value (put option) of the underlying.\nWith lookback options, both the calculated strike price and the calculated value of the underlying can \nvary considerably from the market prices prevailing on the expiry date. Investors selling options of this \ntype must be aware that they will always be exercised at the most unfavourable value for them.\nPerformance\nUnderlyingProfit\nLossPremium0\nStrike price\nThe buyer of a contingent option must pay the premium only if the market value of the underlying \nreaches or exceeds the strike price during the term of the option (American-style option, see Glossary ) or \non the expiry date (European-style option, see Glossary ).Swiss Bankers Association \u00b7 Risks Involved in T rading Financial Instruments503  Detailed explanations of individual financial instruments\nOptions on multiple underlyings\nSpread and outperformance options are two examples of options on multiple underlyings. Both have two \nunderlyings. The value of a spread option is calculated from the absolute difference in the performance \nof the two underlyings. The value of an outperformance option, meanwhile, is calculated from the relative \ndifference, i.e. the percentage by which one underlying outperforms the other. \nEven if the value of an underlying increases, the difference in performance may remain the same or even \nfall in either absolute or relative terms, decreasing the value of the option.\nCompound options\nCompound options have an option as their underlying, i.e. they are options on options. Compound \noptions can have an especially large leverage effect. Investors selling (writing) them must be prepared for \nvery high liabilities.\nCredit default options\nCredit default options transfer a credit risk from the original risk-taker (risk seller) to a third party (risk \nbuyer), who receives a premium in return. If the predefined credit event occurs, the risk buyer is obliged \nto pay a cash settlement or take on the non-performing loan (or another delivery obligation) by way of \nphysical settlement at a predetermined price. Credit default options are a form of credit derivatives.\nThe risk of chain reactions on the credit market is high and can easily be underestimated. There is also the \nrisk that a lack of liquidity will lead to price distortions when volumes are low. This may mean that the \ninvestment can only be sold at a low price or over the longer term or perhaps even that it cannot be sold \nat all.The buyer must pay the entire premium even if the option is only just at the money or just in the money.\n  \nCliquet and ladder options\nThe strike price of a cliquet option (also known as a ratchet option) is adjusted in line with the market \nvalue of the underlying, usually at regular intervals. Any intrinsic value the option has is locked in when \nthis adjustment is made, and these lock-ins are accrued throughout the option\u2019s term.\nThe strike price of a ladder option is adjusted when the underlying reaches specified market prices, rather \nthan at regular intervals. As a rule, only the highest intrinsic value is locked in, but all intrinsic values \nrecorded during the term may be accrued in exceptional cases.\nInvestors selling a cliquet option must pay the buyer all the accrued lock-ins in addition to any intrinsic \nvalue of the option on expiry. Investors selling a ladder option must pay the buyer the highest lock-in \namount. It must be borne in mind that the lock-in amount may be considerably higher than the option\u2019s \nintrinsic value on the expiry date.\nSource: SBASwiss Bankers Association \u00b7 Risks Involved in T rading Financial Instruments513  Detailed explanations of individual financial instruments\n3.4 Structured products\nVoting or participation rights \nThe buyer of a structured product does not normally acquire voting rights and may not be entitled to \ndividends on the underlying asset. Participation products are often different in this respect, and include a \nnet dividend after deduction of withholding tax. This net dividend may be wholly or partly retained \n(reinvested), periodically distributed or incorporated as a discount (see Glossary ) into the issue price.\nSpecial risks\nUnlike with collective investment schemes, the issuer of a structured product is liable with their own \nassets, as is any guarantor to the extent of the guarantee; the underlying assets do not benefit from \nspecial protection. Investors must therefore be prepared to accept not just the potential loss due to the \nchange in market value of the underlyings (market risk) but also, in the worst case, loss of their entire \ninvestment if the issuer or guarantor becomes insolvent (issuer\u2009/\u2009guarantor risk, see Glossary ).\n3.4.1  Capital protection products\nTypes of capital protection\nSome structured products offer capital protection. The level of this protection is fixed by the issuer when \nthe product is issued and indicates the minimum percentage of the nominal value that will be repaid to \nthe investor on expiry. However, capital protection only applies at the end of the term and may, depend-\ning on the product conditions, be less than 100\u2009% of the invested capital. Only financial instruments \noffering 100\u2009% capital protection guarantee that the investor will receive the full nominal value on expiry.\nThe accepted standard in the structured products market is that a financial instrument can be described as \na capital protection product if it offers at least 90\u2009% protection. If it is lower, the term \u201cminimum repay -\nment\u201d is normally used, and the instrument is classified as a yield enhancement or participation product.Swiss Bankers Association \u00b7 Risks Involved in T rading Financial Instruments52Example: Capital protection with participation\nExample: Capital protection with barrierFig. 13\nFig. 14In a capital protection product with participation, the buyer participates in any further rise in the market \nprice of an underlying once it reaches the strike price.\nSource: SSPA\nIn a barrier capital protection product, the buyer participates in any further rise in the market price of  \nan underlying once it reaches the strike price up to a barrier. If the price rises above the barrier, the value \nof the product drops back to the capital protection level. The investor receives a coupon (rebate) instead  \nof the participation.\nSource: SSPA3  Detailed explanations of individual financial instruments\nPerformance\nPerformanceUnderlying\nUnderlyingProfit\nProfitLoss\nLoss0\n0Strike\nStrikeBarrier\nRebateSwiss Bankers Association \u00b7 Risks Involved in T rading Financial Instruments533  Detailed explanations of individual financial instruments\nExample: Capital protection with couponFig. 15\nIn a capital protection product with coupon, a regular coupon is paid out once the strike price is reached. \nThe level of the coupon depends on the performance of the underlying.\nSource: SSPAPerformance\nUnderlyingProfit\nLoss0Coupon\nHow capital protection products work\nStructured products with capital protection normally consist of two elements, such as a fixed-income \ninvestment (see Glossary , typically a bond or a money market investment) and an option. This combina-\ntion allows the investor to participate in the performance of one or more underlyings through the option \nor participation component, while the capital protection limits the loss risk. The capital protection only \ncovers part of the nominal value, but it defines the minimum repayment the investor receives on expiry, \nregardless of how the participation component performs.\nCapital protection and nominal value\nThe capital protection is linked to the nominal value rather than the issue price or purchase price. Hence, \nif the purchase\u2009/\u2009issue price the investor pays exceeds the nominal value, only the nominal value is \ncapital-protected. The protection of the investor\u2019s capital outlay drops accordingly. Conversely, if the \npurchase/\u2009issue price is less than the nominal value, the protection rises accordingly.\nThe capital protection component can be less than 100\u2009% of the capital invested, depending on the \nfinancial instrument. Therefore, capital protection does not mean 100\u2009% repayment of the nominal value \nor capital outlay for all financial instruments. Structured products with capital protection may yield a \nlower return than a direct investment in the underlying, because the protection comes at a cost.Swiss Bankers Association \u00b7 Risks Involved in T rading Financial Instruments543  Detailed explanations of individual financial instruments\nAn investor wishing to sell a structured product with capital protection before it expires may receive less \nthan the value of the capital protection component, as the protection only applies if the product is held \nuntil the expiry date.\nParticipation component\nThe participation component determines the extent to which an investor can profit from the perfor -\nmance of the underlying(s). In other words, it fixes the level of the potential return over and above the \ncapital protection component. Some structured products with capital protection offer only a limited \npotential participation (those with a cap); some (those without a cap) offer unlimited potential participa-\ntion. Others require the market value of the underlying to touch, rise above or fall below a specific barrier \nbefore a profit can be made.\nThe risk on the participation component is the same as that on the corresponding option or combination \nof options. Depending on the movements in the market value of the underlyings, the participation \ncomponent may be zero.\nSpecial risks\nThe maximum loss on a structured product with capital protection is limited to the difference between \nthe purchase price and the capital protection, provided the product is held until expiry. Capital protec -\ntion offers no protection against issuer risk (see section 1.3). This means that if the debtor of a structured \nproduct becomes insolvent, some or all of the capital invested may still be lost.\n3.4.2  Yield enhancement products\nHow yield enhancement products work\nStructured products with yield enhancement normally consist of two elements, such as a fixed-income invest -\nment (see Glossary ) and an option \u2013 normally on equities or currencies. This combination allows the investor to \nparticipate in the performance of one or more underlyings up to a cap, through the option component. However, \nwith yield enhancement products the minimum repayment is either absent or conditional, and they normally bet \non underlyings trending sideways or slightly upwards. The interest paid or discount on the issue price offers the \ninvestor a higher return than on a direct investment if the price of the underlying remains essentially unchanged. \nOn the other hand, the investor will not benefit from the full potential return of the underlying.\nIf the price of the underlying rises, the investor will receive the interest and nominal value paid out on expiry. \nThere may also be provision for a discount on the issue price. If the market value of the underlying rises sharply,  \na direct investment may achieve a higher return. Conversely if it falls sharply, the investor receives a cash settle-\nment or delivery of the underlying on expiry, and so will also participate in the negative performance of the Swiss Bankers Association \u00b7 Risks Involved in T rading Financial Instruments553  Detailed explanations of individual financial instruments\nExample: Yield enhancement with barrier and capFig. 16\nAs long as the barrier is never touched, the maximum repayment (cap) or the nominal value plus a \ncoupon is repaid.

The nearer the barrier is to the market price of the underlying on the day of \nissue, the higher the interest the investor will normally receive. However, this also entails the risk of the \nbarrier being reached.\nIn the worst case, the entire capital invested in a yield enhancement product may be lost.Swiss Bankers Association \u00b7 Risks Involved in T rading Financial Instruments57Example: Classical participationFig. 18\nThe investor participates 1:1 in the performance of the underlying.\nSource: SSPA3  Detailed explanations of individual financial instruments\n3.4.3  Participation products\nHow participation products work\nStructured products with participation enable the investor to participate in the performance of one or \nmore underlyings. Often they have neither a profit ceiling nor capital protection. However, they may offer \na conditional minimum repayment, in which case the risk is smaller than with a direct investment provided \nthe market value of the underlying does not reach a specific barrier (termed the \u201cknock-out\u201d).\nIf it touches, rises above or falls below the barrier, the minimum repayment is forfeited.

Normally they \nare variants on a conventional capital protection, yield enhancement or participation product with the \nbasic structure extended to include an additional reference (corporate or government) bond. Repayment \ndepends in particular on the non-occurrence of a credit event involving the reference entity, as defined in \nthe relevant product description. In the absence of such an event, reference entity certificates work in the \nsame way as comparable capital protection, yield enhancement or participation products. Owing to the \nadditional risk, these products offer better conditions, such as higher coupons.\nIf a relevant credit event occurs, the financial instrument may fall due and be repaid before expiry. The \nrepayment amount is related to the credit event, and may be zero.Special risks\nSome financial instruments with participation are based on more than one underlying and provide for the \ninvestor to receive the security with the worst (or sometimes best) performance on expiry. The underly -\ning is delivered or a cash settlement is paid if the underlying touches, rises above or falls below a prede-\nfined barrier during the term of the financial instrument. The financial instrument can trade some way \nbelow the issue price during its term even if the barrier has not yet been touched, exceeded or undershot. \nMoreover, the level of participation is directly related to the level of the barrier. An investor who has \naccepted a higher level of risk when choosing the barrier will participate with a larger amount. \nIn the worst case, the entire capital invested in a structured product with participation can be lost.\nSpecial risks\nThe risk of a reference entity certificate depends not just on the normal risks of comparable capital \nprotection, yield enhancement or participation products and the issuer risk, but also on the creditworthi-\nness of the reference entity. In the worst case, the entire capital invested can be lost.Swiss Bankers Association \u00b7 Risks Involved in T rading Financial Instruments603  Detailed explanations of individual financial instruments\n3.5 Forwards and futures\nHow initial and variation margins work\nAn investor forward selling or buying an underlying asset they do not possess (short selling) must be able \nto supply a specified initial margin when entering into the contract. This is usually a percentage of the \ntotal value of the contracted instruments. In addition, a variation margin (see Glossary ) is calculated \nperiodically during the life of the contract. This corresponds to the book profit or loss arising from any \nchange in the value of the contract or underlying instrument. The way in which the variation margin is \ncalculated will depend on the rules of the exchange concerned and the terms of the contract.\nThe investor must deposit the required initial and variation margin with the securities dealer (see Glossary ) \nfor the entire life of the contract. In the event of a book loss, the variation margin can be several times as \nlarge as the initial margin. If the investor cannot make the variation margin payment quickly enough, the \nsecurities dealer may unilaterally close out the transaction, in which case the investor loses the opportunity \nto profit from a favourable trend in the underlying up to expiry.\nClosing out\nThe investor can close out the transaction at any time before the expiry date or the next possible delivery \ndate (\u201cfirst notice day\u201d), usually at normal market conditions. The nature of the closing out (see Glossary ) \nwill depend on the type of contract and the practice of the exchange, particularly with regard to price \nlimits (see section 2.8). Either the financial instrument is sold, or an offsetting trade under identical \ncontractual conditions is agreed with the counterparty so that the obligations to deliver and receive \ncancel one another out.Special risks of credit-linked notes (CLNs)\nCredit-linked notes (CLNs) are bonds whose repayment and interest payment depend on the perfor -\nmance of a specific underlying or reference portfolio \u2013 such as a loan or bond.\nParticular attention should be paid to the creditworthiness of the debtor to which the CLN is linked, as a \ncredit event may render it worthless. There is an issuer risk (see Glossary ), i.e. a credit risk of the issuing \nbank, just as with other structured products. There is also a leverage effect on fluctuations in the under -\nlying and the creditworthiness of the issuer during the term. The secondary market for CLNs has limited \nliquidity, which may make it impossible for the investor to sell the CLN before the end of the term.Swiss Bankers Association \u00b7 Risks Involved in T rading Financial Instruments613  Detailed explanations of individual financial instruments\nSettlement and special risks\nIf the transaction is not closed out before the expiry date or the first notice day, the investor and the \ncounterparty (see Glossary ) must settle it. If the underlying of a forward contract is a physical asset, the \ncontract may provide for physical delivery or a cash payment. Generally, the asset is physically delivered. \nOnly in exceptional cases do the contract provisions or exchange practice call for cash settlement.  \nAll other settlement specifications, especially the place of fulfilment, can be found in the relevant \ncontract provisions. \nThe difference between physical delivery and cash settlement is that with physical delivery, underlyings \namounting to the entire contractual value must be delivered, whereas with cash settlement, only the \ndifference between the agreed price and the market value on settlement needs to be paid. This means \nthat where the contract provides for physical delivery, the investor will need either more funds available \nthan for cash settlement or the underlying assets.\n3.6 Offshore funds and hedge funds\nOffshore funds\nIn general, a distinction is made between collective investment schemes (see section 3.2) domiciled in \ncountries with strict legislation \u2013 such as Switzerland or the EU \u2013 and those domiciled in countries with \ncomparatively relaxed legislation \u2013 such as the Cayman Islands or British Virgin Islands. The former are \nreferred to as onshore funds, and the latter as offshore funds.\nHedge funds\nMany offshore funds are hedge funds. Despite what their name suggests, hedge funds do not necessarily \nhave anything to do with hedging. Indeed, they sometimes take on very high levels of risk in order to \nobtain an above-average return. Hedge funds include forms of investment funds, investment companies \nand partnerships that use derivatives not just for hedging but also for investment, and that are able to \nengage in short selling or take on significant leverage by borrowing.\nAs with other types of collective investment schemes, a hedge fund\u2019s performance often depends on the \nexpertise of a single person \u2013 the manager \u2013 or a small group of key individuals. Incorrect decisions or the \nloss of such people can have a direct impact on the hedge fund\u2019s performance. The dependence on a \nsingle fund manager can be reduced by, for example, investing in a fund of funds or multi-manager fund. \nFunds of funds invest their capital in a number of target funds. Multi-manager funds, meanwhile, are \nspread across a number of fund managers covering a range of investment styles, markets and financial \ninstruments (see section 3.2.4 ).Swiss Bankers Association \u00b7 Risks Involved in T rading Financial Instruments623  Detailed explanations of individual financial instruments\nT ransparency\nBecause they are not subject to strict legislation, offshore funds are in principle less transparent. Their \ninvestment strategies are often highly complex and very difficult to understand. Investors are often \ninsufficiently aware of changes of strategy that may lead to a significant increase in risk, or do not find out \nabout them until it is too late. Managers frequently deliberately hold back information in order to exploit \nmarket inefficiencies and information advantages or to prevent certain insights into market mechanisms. \nThe intransparency and complexity of many investment strategies is designed to prevent copying of \nintellectual property. Depending on the quality of the fund managers, investors may not always be informed \nof the planned strategies and changes to them or a change of portfolio manager. Offshore funds are also \nnot subject to any publication requirements (see Glossary ). Hedge funds can use fictional or pro forma \nperformance data that are not based on actually completed transactions and should therefore be treated \nwith caution.\nT o link the investors\u2019 interests more closely to those of the manager, it is also customary for managers of \nsuch funds to receive performance-related bonuses and be invested in their own funds.\nInvestment techniques\nThe investment techniques employed by hedge funds include the extensive use of short selling, leverage, \nswaps, arbitrage (exploiting price or interest rate differences between markets, see Glossary ), derivatives \nand algorithmic (automated) trading (see Glossary ). The investment strategy may employ derivatives \nsuch as futures, options and swaps, which entails greater risks. These financial instruments may be subject Special risks\nOffshore funds and hedge funds are subject to little or no regulation and minimal or no licensing require-\nments, and are not overseen by a supervisory authority. The same applies to their managers. In particular, \noffshore and hedge funds are not subject to the numerous investor protection regulations that apply to \napproved collective investment schemes, such as rules on liquidity, the option to redeem fund units at \nany time, avoidance of conflicts of interest, fair pricing of fund units, and disclosing and limiting leverage. \nIt is often difficult or even impossible to assert the rights of investors in offshore countries if problems \noccur with a fund. \nThe quality of self-imposed investment guidelines and the selection of independent third parties, the \nbank, custodian and auditors can vary. In the case of reputable fund managers, these meet international \nstandards.\nOffshore funds, and in particular hedge funds, make full use of their freedom to choose asset classes, \nmarkets \u2013 including high-risk countries \u2013 and trading methods. This can lead to greater diversification \nand, under certain circumstances, stable absolute returns, but in unfavourable market situations there is a \nrisk of extremely negative performance, up to and including total loss.Swiss Bankers Association \u00b7 Risks Involved in T rading Financial Instruments633  Detailed explanations of individual financial instruments\nto significant price volatility, resulting in a high risk of loss for the fund. The low margins required to build \nup a position in such instruments mean that high levels of borrowing can be used. Depending on the \ninstrument, a relatively small change in the contract price (see Glossary ) can lead to a large profit or loss \ncompared with the margin deposited. Such losses may be unforeseeable, result in further losses and \nexceed any margin. If a hedge fund sells uncovered options on securities, it may be exposing itself to an \nunlimited risk of loss.\nThe acquisition of units in hedge funds is complex and not standardised. The minimum investments \nrequired are often high and subscriptions can normally be made only once a month, quarter or year, and \nthe required documentation must be completed correctly. The amount subscribed must normally be \ntransferred several days or weeks before the subscription deadline, which entails an additional counter -\nparty risk (see Glossary ).\nLiquidity and fees\nOffshore and hedge funds have limited liquidity. Their investment techniques often involve investments \nin illiquid financial instruments or instruments with limited scope for transfer. The payment and redemption \noptions are often limited, for example to only once a month, quarter or year, and may require long notice \nperiods. Failure to comply will incur large fees. There are often also lengthy lock-up periods during which \ninvestors are required to leave their capital in the fund. Some hedge funds reserve the right to retain part \nof the proceeds for a specific period if an investor redeems their entire investment, mostly until the next \nordinary audit.\nHedge funds are not normally admitted to trading on an exchange and the scope for selling on the \nsecondary market is very limited or non-existent. It may be impossible to unwind an existing position or \ndetermine the value or risk of a position.\nSubscription, sale and redemption\nA hedge fund\u2019s articles of incorporation often give its governing bodies extensive freedom. For example, \nthey are not obliged to calculate the net asset value (NAV, see Glossary ) at all times. A hedge fund\u2019s NAV \nis not normally known when an investor invests in it or redeems their investment. The NAV is not generally \npublished until the first official subscription or sale date, depending on the strategy. The fund managers \nare also often allowed to suspend redemptions at their discretion. This is normally in the interests of the \nexisting investors, ensuring that all are treated equally. Finally, hedge funds may be allowed to compulso-\nrily redeem all or part of an investment at any time, with little notice and without giving reasons.\nIt may also be difficult or impossible to transfer the investment to a financial service provider, especially \nwhen the beneficial owner of the investment is no longer the same. Moreover, offshore funds often do \nnot provide for interim distributions, for example of share dividends.\nThe various types of hedge fund strategies are outlined below.Swiss Bankers Association \u00b7 Risks Involved in T rading Financial Instruments643  Detailed explanations of individual financial instruments\nExamples of hedge fund strategies \nLong\u2009/\u2009short equity\nEquity hedge funds identify both undervalued shares \u2013 buy or long positions \u2013 and overvalued shares \u2013  \nsell or short positions \u2013 in specific regions and market segments (see Glossary > Short\u2009/\u2009long position ). \nThey seek to profit from closing out the positions at a profit sooner or later.\nArbitrage\nArbitrage strategies identify price differences between identical or similar investments in different \nmarkets and try to exploit them. Such strategies include equity market neutral, fixed-income arbitrage, \nconvertible bond arbitrage and mortgage-backed securities arbitrage.\nEvent-driven\nManagers that pursue event-driven strategies try to make a profit from events such as upcoming changes \nin a company (mergers, takeovers, restructurings, turnarounds, etc.). Examples of such strategies are \nmerger arbitrage, distressed securities and special situations.\nGlobal macro\nHedge funds that pursue global macro strategies attempt to identify macroeconomic trends such as \nchanges in interest or exchange rates at an early stage and exploit them for profit. This category includes \ngrowth funds and emerging market funds.\nManaged futures\nThis type of hedge fund deals in futures (standardised, exchange-listed contracts) on financial instru-\nments, currencies and commodities.\n3.7 Private equity\nFinancing types and strategies\nPrivate equity involves investments in young companies (start-ups) and companies with growth potential \nthat are still in an early stage of their development. This category is termed venture capital. Private \nequity is also used to fund the growth or expansion of an existing company. This is known as late stage or \nmezzanine financing. Private equity also comes into play when a company is about to go public or to be \nsold. This type of financing aims primarily to refund the existing owners\u2019 original investment with a \npremium (multiple) from the proceeds of the initial public offering (IPO) or sale. Changes of ownership, \nfor example when a company is delisted or sold to a strategic investor, generally involve some kind of \nbuy-out: a management buy-out (MBO), management buy-in (MBI) or leveraged buy-out (LBO).Swiss Bankers Association \u00b7 Risks Involved in T rading Financial Instruments653  Detailed explanations of individual financial instruments\nThe primary goal of private equity is to invest in a company for a limited period and then sell the invest -\nment at a profit. The success of a private equity investment therefore depends not just on choosing the \nright time to enter or exit or sell the company, but also on the financing strategy the management has \nimplemented. The strategies differ depending on the stage the company has reached. They include venture \ncapital strategies, buy-out strategies, turnaround strategies and mezzanine strategies. The choice of \nfinancing solution, whether direct or indirect, will depend largely on the market conditions prevailing in \nthe investment environment at the time. The performance of the equity and bond markets, as well as \nother specific private equity factors, will determine how easy or difficult the exit phase is and whether the \nproceeds meet expectations.\nSpecial risks\nNormally, private equity investments cannot be sold until some years after the original investment. There \nmay be no provision for any interim distributions, or at least not until after a few years. In this case, the \nonly prospect of a return is the capital gain that can be realised when the investment reaches the end of \nits term. In some cases it may be difficult to transfer the investment to another bank.\nCompanies that are potential candidates for private equity investments may have high levels of borrow -\ning and therefore be more sensitive than established companies to negative market developments such \nas rising interest rates. There is also a greater danger of the company becoming insolvent and going \nbankrupt than with listed companies.\n \nPrivate equity investors normally undertake in advance to invest a fixed amount (capital commitment) \nthat may be immediately and irrevocably blocked at the bank. They may lose the ability to dispose of the \ncapital as they see fit, even if the private equity vehicle does not require actual transfer of the full sum or \npart of it until later. This is known as making a capital call. In other cases, investors must simply ensure \nthat sufficient liquidity is available when a capital call is made. If they fail to meet the call within a defined \ntime period, they may be subject to sanctions set out in the limited partnership agreement that may \nentail the loss of part or all of the investment.\nCertain private equity vehicles provide for mechanisms whereby investors may, under certain circum-\nstances, be required to repay distributions already made at a later date. This is known as a clawback or \nrecallable distribution.\nIn exceptional cases, investors may be asked to increase their stake. Investors supplying new capital may \nincrease their prospects of making a profit, but also increase the risk to which they are exposed by the \nsame degree, which may include the loss of their entire investment.Swiss Bankers Association \u00b7 Risks Involved in T rading Financial Instruments663  Detailed explanations of individual financial instruments\n3 . 7.1  Indirect investments in private equity\nWith an indirect private equity investment, for example via a private equity fund, the skills of the fund \nmanager are key. There is no guarantee that the manager of a private equity fund will be able to make \ninvestments and generate profits that fulfil the expectations for this form of investment. In general, the \nmanagers of such funds receive performance-related bonuses or remuneration and are often invested  \nin the fund themselves, giving them what is known as \u201cskin in the game\u201d. The risks of an indirect investment \nare essentially the same as those of a direct investment, particularly as regards the capital call mechanism \nand limited liquidity.Swiss Bankers Association \u00b7 Risks Involved in T rading Financial Instruments674 Appendix\n4 Appendix\n4.1 Glossary\nT erm Explanation\nActively managed fund Type of investment fund in which the fund manager tries to generate added value\nthrough targeted security selection, see section 3.2.3.\nAlgorithmic trading Automatic issuing of buy and sell orders controlled by computer programs.\nAlternative (non-traditional) investment An instrument that has little or no correlation with the conventional financial \nmarkets, such as equities and bonds.

The main purposes are to \ncombat tax evasion, money laundering and terrorist financing, to enforce sanctions, to \ncomply with local requirements in general and/or to allow the transactions to be carried \nout. The information concerning the ordering customer / recipient includes, for e xample, \nname, date of birth, nationality, domicile, origin of the assets, duration of the banking \nrelationship, relationship between the ordering customer and recipient, and any agency \nrelationships; and, in the case of companies, for example the business activity, purpose, \nownership structure, beneficial owners, organisational structure and number of employees. \nAs regards the payment order, it may include information such as the reason for and \ncontext of the payment, any suspicious compliance -related facto rs, as well as details of \nother similar payments.  The banks and system operators referred to are primarily the \nordering customer\u2019s and recipient\u2019s banks, correspondent banks and operators of payment \nsystems (e.g. in Switzerland SIX Interbank Clearing AG) o r SWIFT.  It is also possible that \nthose involved in the transaction may transfer the data, for example to regulators, \nauthorities or other third parties in Switzerland or abroad.  Additionally, the recipient of the \npayment order, whether in Switzerland or a broad, may receive information about the \nordering customer, or vice versa.  \nWhat should you expect when making investments in foreign securities?  \nDuring the processing of transactions involving foreign securities, or domestic securities \nlinked to foreign cu rrencies (e.g. Swiss investment funds with currency classes), and when \nsuch securities are held in custody, extensive information may have to be disclosed to the \nbanks, system operators and other third parties involved, both in Switzerland and abroad. \nThe main purposes are to combat tax evasion, money laundering and terrorist financing, to \nenforce sanctions, to comply with local requirements in general and/or to allow the \ntransactions to be carried out. The information includes, for example, name, date of b irth, \nnationality and domicile of the investor, beneficial owner, ordering customer or recipient in \nthe case of securities transactions, origin of the assets, duration of the banking \nrelationship, relationship between the investor, ordering customer and re cipient, \nrelationship between the investor and the issuer, any agency relationships; and, in the \ncase of companies, for example the business activity, purpose, ownership structure, \nbeneficial owners, organisational structure and number of employees.   \n   \n \n \n \nSchweizerische Bankiervereinigung  Aeschenplatz 7 T +41 61 295 93 93  \nAssociation suisse des banquiers  Postfach 4182  F +41 61 272 53 82  \nAssociazione Svizzera dei Banchieri  CH-4002  Basel    office@sba.ch  \nSwiss Bankers Association     www.swissbanking.org  The banks and other financial market infrastructures referre d to are primarily securities \ntrading platforms, clearing houses and custodians.  It is also possible that the parties \ninvolved in processing the transactions and custody of the securities may transfe r the data, \nfor example to regulators or authorities in Switzerland or abroad or to other third parties.  \nAdditionally, the recipient in a securities transaction, whether in Switzerland or abroad, \nmay for example receive information about the ordering custo mer. \nWhy is this information disclosed?  \nIn particular, the banks and system operators in Switzerland and abroad that are involved \nin payment transactions and the processing of transactions involving foreign securities, \nand that act as custodians for such s ecurities, increasingly require extensive information \nabout the parties involved as well as further background information about the \ntransactions.  This information is disclosed in order to answer specific enquiries from such \nentities, so that they can sati sfy the requirements applicable to them.  It also helps to \nensure that the services concerned are provided in a correct way .  \nIs information about you and your transactions protected abroad?  \nOnce information about you and your transactions leaves Switzerlan d it is no longer \nprotected by Swiss law (e.g. Swiss bank -client confidentiality or the Federal Act on Data \nProtection), but is subject to the law of the country concerned.  Foreign laws and official \norders may, for example, require the information to be fo rwarded to authorities, \nsupervisory bodies or other third parties.  \n ",
